.IP "codec_dai" 12

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The value of MCLK is used to determine which sample rates are supported
by the STA32X, based on the mclk_ratios table.

This function must be called by the machine driver's 'startup' function,
otherwise the list of supported sample rates will not be available in
time for ALSA.

For setups with variable MCLKs, pass 0 as 'freq' argument. This will cause
theoretically possible sample rates to be enabled. Call it again with a
proper value set one the external clock is set (most probably you would do
that from a machine's driver 'hw_param' hook.
