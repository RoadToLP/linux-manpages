.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Start from the end of the ice_res_tracker and return right when we find the
first res->list entry with the ICE_RES_VALID_BIT set. This function is only
valid for SR-IOV because it is the only consumer that manipulates the
res->end and this is always called when res->end is set to res->num_entries.
