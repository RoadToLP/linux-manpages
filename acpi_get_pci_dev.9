Given an ACPI CA handle, the desired PCI device is located in the
list of PCI devices.

If the device is found, its reference count is increased and this
function returns a pointer to its data structure.  The caller must
decrement the reference count by calling \fBpci_dev_put\fP.
If no device is found, NULL is returned.
