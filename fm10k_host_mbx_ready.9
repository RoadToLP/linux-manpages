.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function checks if the PF interface's mailbox is ready before queueing
mailbox messages for transmission. This will prevent filling the TX mailbox
queue when the receiver is not ready. VF interfaces are exempt from this
check since it will block all PF-VF mailbox messages from being sent from
the VF to the PF at initialization.
