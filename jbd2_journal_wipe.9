.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Wipe out all of the contents of a journal, safely.  This will produce
a warning if the journal contains any valid recovery information.
Must be called between journal_init_*() and \fBjbd2_journal_load\fP.

If 'write' is non-zero, then we wipe out the journal on disk; otherwise
we merely suppress recovery.
