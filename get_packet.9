# of remaining buffers before we start dropping packets

Get the next packet from a free list and complete setup of the
sk_buff.  If the packet is small we make a copy and recycle the
original buffer, otherwise we use the original buffer itself.  If a
positive drop threshold is supplied packets are dropped and their
buffers recycled if (a) the number of remaining buffers is under the
threshold and the packet is too big to copy, or (b) the packet should
be copied but there is no memory for the copy.
