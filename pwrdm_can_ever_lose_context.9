.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Given a struct powerdomain * \fIpwrdm\fP, returns 1 if the powerdomain
can lose either memory or logic context or if \fIpwrdm\fP is invalid, or
returns 0 otherwise.  This function is not concerned with how the
powerdomain registers are programmed (i.e., to go off or not); it's
concerned with whether it's ever possible for this powerdomain to
go off while some other part of the chip is active.  This function
assumes that every powerdomain can go to either ON or INACTIVE.
