.SH NAME
parport_read \- read a block of data from a parallel port
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "ssize_t" parport_read
.BI "(struct parport *port "  ","
.BI "void *buffer "  ","
.BI "size_t len "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "port" 12
port to read from
.IP "buffer" 12
data buffer (in kernel space)
.IP "len" 12
number of bytes of data to transfer

This will read up to \fIlen\fP bytes of \fIbuffer\fP to the port
specified, using the IEEE 1284 transfer mode most recently
negotiated to (using \fBparport_negotiate\fP), as long as that
mode supports reverse transfers (peripheral to host).

It is the caller's responsibility to ensure that the first
\fIlen\fP bytes of \fIbuffer\fP are available to write to.

This function returns the number of bytes transferred (if zero
or positive), or else an error code.
