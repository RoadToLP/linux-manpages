the drive to place in DMA mode

If the drive supports at least mode 2 DMA or UDMA of any kind
then attempt to place it into DMA mode. Drives that are known to
support DMA but predate the DMA properties or that are known
to have DMA handling bugs are also set up appropriately based
on the good/bad drive lists.
