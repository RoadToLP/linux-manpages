.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The function is expected to be called by EEH core while it gets
special EEH event (without binding PE). The function calls to
OPAL APIs for next error to handle. The informational error is
handled internally by platform. However, the dead IOC, dead PHB,
fenced PHB and frozen PE should be handled by EEH core eventually.
