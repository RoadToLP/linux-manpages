.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" lpfc_els_chk_latt
.BI "(struct lpfc_vport *vport "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "vport" 12
pointer to a host virtual N_Port data structure.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This routine checks whether there is an outstanding host link
attention event during the discovery process with the \fIvport\fP. It is done
by reading the HBA's Host Attention (HA) register. If there is any host
link attention events during this \fIvport\fP's discovery process, the \fIvport\fP
shall be marked as FC_ABORT_DISCOVERY, a host link attention clear shall
be issued if the link state is not already in host link cleared state,
and a return code shall indicate whether the host link attention event
had happened.

Note that, if either the host link is in state LPFC_LINK_DOWN or \fIvport\fP
state in LPFC_VPORT_READY, the request for checking host link attention
event will be ignored and a return code shall indicate no host link
attention event had happened.

Return codes
0 - no host link attention event happened
1 - host link attention event happened
