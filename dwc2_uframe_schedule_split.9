.SH "DESCRIPTION"

This is the most complicated thing in USB.  We have to find matching time
in both the global high speed schedule for the port and the low speed
schedule for the TT associated with the given device.

Being here means that the host must be running in high speed mode and the
device is in low or full speed mode (and behind a hub).
