.SH NAME
fc_block_scsi_eh \- Block SCSI eh thread for blocked fc_rport
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" fc_block_scsi_eh
.BI "(struct scsi_cmnd *cmnd "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "cmnd" 12
SCSI command that scsi_eh is trying to recover
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This routine can be called from a FC LLD scsi_eh callback. It
blocks the scsi_eh thread until the fc_rport leaves the
FC_PORTSTATE_BLOCKED, or the fast_io_fail_tmo fires. This is
necessary to avoid the scsi_eh failing recovery actions for blocked
rports which would lead to offlined SCSI devices.
.SH "RETURN"
0 if the fc_rport left the state FC_PORTSTATE_BLOCKED.
FAST_IO_FAIL if the fast_io_fail_tmo fired, this should be
passed back to scsi_eh.
