.SH NAME
__audit_syscall_exit \- deallocate audit context after a system call
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" __audit_syscall_exit
.BI "(int success "  ","
.BI "long return_code "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "success" 12
success value of the syscall
.IP "return_code" 12
return value of the syscall
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Tear down after system call.  If the audit context has been marked as
auditable (either because of the AUDIT_RECORD_CONTEXT state from
filtering, or because some other part of the kernel wrote an audit
message), then write out the syscall information.  In call cases,
free the names stored from \fBgetname\fP.
