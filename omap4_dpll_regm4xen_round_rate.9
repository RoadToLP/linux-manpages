.SH NAME
omap4_dpll_regm4xen_round_rate \- round DPLL rate, considering REGM4XEN bit
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "long" omap4_dpll_regm4xen_round_rate
.BI "(struct clk_hw *hw "  ","
.BI "unsigned long target_rate "  ","
.BI "unsigned long *parent_rate "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "hw" 12
struct hw_clk containing the struct clk * of the DPLL to round a rate for
.IP "target_rate" 12
the desired rate of the DPLL
.IP "parent_rate" 12
clock rate of the DPLL parent
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Compute the rate that would be programmed into the DPLL hardware
for \fIclk\fP if \fBset_rate\fP were to be provided with the rate
\fItarget_rate\fP.  Takes the REGM4XEN bit into consideration, which is
needed for the OMAP4 ABE DPLL.  Returns the rounded rate (before
M-dividers) upon success, -EINVAL if \fIclk\fP is null or not a DPLL, or
~0 if an error occurred in \fBomap2_dpll_round_rate\fP.
