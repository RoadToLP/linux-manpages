.SH NAME
inode_congested \- test whether an inode is congested
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" inode_congested
.BI "(struct inode *inode "  ","
.BI "int cong_bits "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "inode" 12
inode to test for congestion (may be NULL)
.IP "cong_bits" 12
mask of WB_[a]sync_congested bits to test
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Tests whether \fIinode\fP is congested.  \fIcong_bits\fP is the mask of congestion
bits to test and the return value is the mask of set bits.

If cgroup writeback is enabled for \fIinode\fP, the congestion state is
determined by whether the cgwb (cgroup bdi_writeback) for the blkcg
associated with \fIinode\fP is congested; otherwise, the root wb's congestion
state is used.

\fIinode\fP is allowed to be NULL as this function is often called on
mapping->host which is NULL for the swapper space.
