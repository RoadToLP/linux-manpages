.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The primary function for recovering the log contents when mounting a
journaled device.

Recovery is done in three passes.  In the first pass, we look for the
end of the log.  In the second, we assemble the list of revoke
blocks.  In the third and final pass, we replay any un-revoked blocks
in the log.
