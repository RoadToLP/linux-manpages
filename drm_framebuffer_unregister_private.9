.SH NAME
drm_framebuffer_unregister_private \- unregister a private fb from the lookup idr
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" drm_framebuffer_unregister_private
.BI "(struct drm_framebuffer *fb "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "fb" 12
fb to unregister
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Drivers need to call this when cleaning up driver-private framebuffers, e.g.
those used for fbdev. Note that the caller must hold a reference of its own,
i.e. the object may not be destroyed through this call (since it'll lead to a
locking inversion).
.SH "NOTE"
This function is deprecated. For driver-private framebuffers it is not
recommended to embed a framebuffer struct info fbdev struct, instead, a
framebuffer pointer is preferred and \fBdrm_framebuffer_put\fP should be called
when the framebuffer is to be cleaned up.
