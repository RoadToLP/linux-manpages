.SH NAME
zfcp_fsf_scnprint_fc_security \- translate FC Endpoint Security flags into mnemonics and place in a buffer
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "ssize_t" zfcp_fsf_scnprint_fc_security
.BI "(char *buf "  ","
.BI "size_t size "  ","
.BI "u32 fc_security "  ","
.BI "enum zfcp_fsf_print_fmt fmt "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "buf" 12
the buffer to place the translated FC Endpoint Security flag(s)
into
.IP "size" 12
the size of the buffer, including the trailing null space
.IP "fc_security" 12
one or more FC Endpoint Security flags, or zero
.IP "fmt" 12
specifies whether a list or a single item is to be put into the
buffer
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The Fibre Channel (FC) Endpoint Security flags are translated into mnemonics.
If the FC Endpoint Security flags are zero "none" is placed into the buffer.

With ZFCP_FSF_PRINT_FMT_LIST the mnemonics are placed as a list separated by
a comma followed by a space into the buffer. If one or more FC Endpoint
Security flags cannot be translated into a mnemonic, as they are undefined
in zfcp_fsf_fc_security_mnemonics, their bitwise ORed value in hexadecimal
representation is placed into the buffer.

With ZFCP_FSF_PRINT_FMT_SINGLEITEM only one single mnemonic is placed into
the buffer. If the FC Endpoint Security flag cannot be translated, as it is
undefined in zfcp_fsf_fc_security_mnemonics, its value in hexadecimal
representation is placed into the buffer. If more than one FC Endpoint
Security flag was specified, their value in hexadecimal representation is
placed into the buffer. The macro ZFCP_FSF_MAX_FC_SECURITY_MNEMONIC_LENGTH
can be used to define a buffer that is large enough to hold one mnemonic.
.SH "RETURN"
The number of characters written into buf not including the trailing
'\0'. If size is == 0 the function returns 0.
