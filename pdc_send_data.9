This function is registered as the send_data function for the mailbox

creates a sequence of receive descriptors in the rx ring. From the source
scatterlist, it creates a sequence of transmit descriptors in the tx ring.
After creating the descriptors, it writes the rx ptr and tx ptr registers to
initiate the DMA transfer.

This function does the DMA map and unmap of the src and dst scatterlists in
the mailbox message.
