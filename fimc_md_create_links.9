.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Parallel interface sensor entities are connected directly to FIMC capture
entities. The sensors using MIPI CSIS bus are connected through immutable
link with CSI receiver entity specified by mux_id. Any registered CSIS
entity has a link to each registered FIMC capture entity. Enabled links
are created by default between each subsequent registered sensor and
subsequent FIMC capture entity. The number of default active links is
determined by the number of available sensors or FIMC entities,
whichever is less.
