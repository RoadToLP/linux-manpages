.SH NAME
pcie_bandwidth_available \- determine minimum link settings of a PCIe device and its bandwidth limitation
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "u32" pcie_bandwidth_available
.BI "(struct pci_dev *dev "  ","
.BI "struct pci_dev **limiting_dev "  ","
.BI "enum pci_bus_speed *speed "  ","
.BI "enum pcie_link_width *width "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dev" 12
PCI device to query
.IP "limiting_dev" 12
storage for device causing the bandwidth limitation
.IP "speed" 12
storage for speed of limiting device
.IP "width" 12
storage for width of limiting device
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Walk up the PCI device chain and find the point where the minimum
bandwidth is available.  Return the bandwidth available there and (if
limiting_dev, speed, and width pointers are supplied) information about
that point.  The bandwidth returned is in Mb/s, i.e., megabits/second of
raw bandwidth.
