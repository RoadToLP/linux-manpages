modifier

Add or remove promiscuity from a device. While the count in the device
remains above zero the interface remains promiscuous. Once it hits zero
the device reverts back to normal filtering operation. A negative inc
value is used to drop promiscuity on the device.
Return 0 if successful or a negative errno code on error.
