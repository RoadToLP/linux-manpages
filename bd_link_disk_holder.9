.SH NAME
bd_link_disk_holder \- create symlinks between holding disk and slave bdev
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" bd_link_disk_holder
.BI "(struct block_device *bdev "  ","
.BI "struct gendisk *disk "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "bdev" 12
the claimed slave bdev
.IP "disk" 12
the holding disk
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
DON'T USE THIS UNLESS YOU'RE ALREADY USING IT.

This functions creates the following sysfs symlinks.

- from "slaves" directory of the holder \fIdisk\fP to the claimed \fIbdev\fP
- from "holders" directory of the \fIbdev\fP to the holder \fIdisk\fP

For example, if /dev/dm-0 maps to /dev/sda and disk for dm-0 is
passed to \fBbd_link_disk_holder\fP, then:

/sys/block/dm-0/slaves/sda --> /sys/block/sda
/sys/block/sda/holders/dm-0 --> /sys/block/dm-0

The caller must have claimed \fIbdev\fP before calling this function and
ensure that both \fIbdev\fP and \fIdisk\fP are valid during the creation and
lifetime of these symlinks.
.SH "CONTEXT"
Might sleep.
.SH "RETURN"
0 on success, -errno on failure.
