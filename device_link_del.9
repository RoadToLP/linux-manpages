.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" device_link_del

Device link to delete.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The caller must ensure proper synchronization of this function with runtime
PM.  If the link was added multiple times, it needs to be deleted as often.
Care is required for hotplugged devices:  Their links are purged on removal
and calling \fBdevice_link_del\fP is then no longer allowed.
