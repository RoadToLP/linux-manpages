.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Returns true if clockdomain \fIclkdm\fP currently has
hardware-supervised idle enabled, or false if it does not or if
\fIclkdm\fP is NULL.  It is only valid to call this function after
\fBclkdm_init\fP has been called.  This function does not actually read
bits from the hardware; it instead tests an in-memory flag that is
changed whenever the clockdomain code changes the auto-idle mode.
