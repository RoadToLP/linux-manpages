.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Lookup blkg for the \fIblkcg\fP - \fIq\fP pair.  If it doesn't exist, try to
create one.  blkg creation is performed recursively from blkcg_root such
that all non-root blkg's have access to the parent blkg.  This function
should be called under RCU read lock and takes \fIq->queue_lock\fP.

Returns the blkg or the closest blkg if \fBblkg_create\fP fails as it walks
down from root.
