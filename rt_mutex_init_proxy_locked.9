.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" rt_mutex_init_proxy_locked
.BI "(struct rt_mutex *lock "  ","
.BI "struct task_struct *proxy_owner "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "lock" 12
the rt_mutex to be locked
.IP "proxy_owner" 12
the task to set as owner
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
No locking. Caller has to do serializing itself

Special API call for PI-futex support. This initializes the rtmutex and
assigns it to \fIproxy_owner\fP. Concurrent operations on the rtmutex are not
possible at this point because the pi_state which contains the rtmutex
is not yet visible to other tasks.
