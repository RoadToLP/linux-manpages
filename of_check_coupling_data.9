.SH NAME
of_check_coupling_data \- Parse rdev's coupling properties and check data consistency
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "bool" of_check_coupling_data
.BI "(struct regulator_dev *rdev "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "rdev" 12
pointer to regulator_dev whose data is checked
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Function checks if all the following conditions are met:
- rdev's max_spread is greater than 0
- all coupled regulators have the same max_spread
- all coupled regulators have the same number of regulator_dev phandles
- all regulators are linked to each other

Returns true if all conditions are met.
