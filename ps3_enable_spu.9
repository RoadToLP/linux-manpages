.SH "DESCRIPTION"

An outstanding enhancement for the PS3 would be to add a guard to check
for incorrect access to the spu problem state when the spu context is
disabled.  This check could be implemented with a flag added to the spu
context that would inhibit mapping problem state pages, and a routine
to unmap spu problem state pages.  When the spu is enabled with
\fBps3_enable_spu\fP the flag would be set allowing pages to be mapped,
and when the spu is disabled with \fBps3_disable_spu\fP the flag would be
cleared and the mapped problem state pages would be unmapped.
