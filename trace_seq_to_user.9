trace_seq_to_user \- copy the squence buffer to user space
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" trace_seq_to_user
.BI "(struct trace_seq *s "  ","
.BI "char __user *ubuf "  ","
.BI "int cnt "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "s" 12
trace sequence descriptor
.IP "ubuf" 12
The userspace memory location to copy to
.IP "cnt" 12
The amount to copy
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Copies the sequence buffer into the userspace memory pointed to
by \fIubuf\fP. It starts from the last read position (\fIs->readpos\fP)
and writes up to \fIcnt\fP characters or till it reaches the end of
the content in the buffer (\fIs->len\fP), which ever comes first.

On success, it returns a positive number of the number of bytes
it copied.

On failure it returns -EBUSY if all of the content in the
sequence has been already read, which includes nothing in the
sequenc (\fIs->len\fP == \fIs->readpos\fP).

Returns -EFAULT if the copy to userspace fails.
