.SH "DESCRIPTION"

OHCI1394 initialization itself and any device going on- or offline
and any cable issue cause a IEEE1394 bus reset. The OHCI1394 spec
specifies that physical DMA is disabled on each bus reset and it
has to be enabled after each bus reset when needed. We resort
to polling here because on early boot, we have no interrupts.
