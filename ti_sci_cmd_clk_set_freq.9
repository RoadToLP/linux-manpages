ti_sci_cmd_clk_set_freq \- Set a frequency for clock
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" ti_sci_cmd_clk_set_freq
.BI "(const struct ti_sci_handle *handle "  ","
.BI "u32 dev_id "  ","
.BI "u32 clk_id "  ","
.BI "u64 min_freq "  ","
.BI "u64 target_freq "  ","
.BI "u64 max_freq "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "handle" 12
pointer to TI SCI handle
.IP "dev_id" 12
Device identifier this request is for
.IP "clk_id" 12
Clock identifier for the device for this request.
Each device has it's own set of clock inputs. This indexes
which clock input to modify.
.IP "min_freq" 12
The minimum allowable frequency in Hz. This is the minimum
allowable programmed frequency and does not account for clock
tolerances and jitter.
.IP "target_freq" 12
The target clock frequency in Hz. A frequency will be
processed as close to this target frequency as possible.
.IP "max_freq" 12
The maximum allowable frequency in Hz. This is the maximum
allowable programmed frequency and does not account for clock
tolerances and jitter.
.SH "RETURN"
0 if all went well, else returns appropriate error value.
