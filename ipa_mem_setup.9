.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" ipa_mem_setup
.BI "(struct ipa *ipa "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS

IPA pointer
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Set up the shared memory regions in IPA local memory.  This involves
zero-filling memory regions, and in the case of header memory, telling
the IPA where it's located.

This function performs the initial setup of this memory.  If the modem
crashes, its regions are re-zeroed in \fBipa_mem_zero_modem\fP.

The AP informs the modem where its portions of memory are located
in a QMI exchange that occurs at modem startup.
.SH "RETURN"
0 if successful, or a negative error code
