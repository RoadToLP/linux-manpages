irq_create_strict_mappings \- Map a range of hw irqs to fixed linux irqs
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" irq_create_strict_mappings
.BI "(struct irq_domain *domain "  ","
.BI "unsigned int irq_base "  ","
.BI "irq_hw_number_t hwirq_base "  ","
.BI "int count "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "domain" 12
domain owning the interrupt range
.IP "irq_base" 12
beginning of linux IRQ range
.IP "hwirq_base" 12
beginning of hardware IRQ range
.IP "count" 12
Number of interrupts to map
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This routine is used for allocating and mapping a range of hardware
irqs to linux irqs where the linux irq numbers are at pre-defined
locations. For use by controllers that already have static mappings
to insert in to the domain.

Non-linear users can use \fBirq_create_identity_mapping\fP for IRQ-at-a-time
domain insertion.

0 is returned upon success, while any failure to establish a static
mapping is treated as an error.
