.SH NAME
lpfc_io_error_detected_s4 \- Method for handling PCI I/O error to SLI-4 device
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "pci_ers_result_t" lpfc_io_error_detected_s4
.BI "(struct pci_dev *pdev "  ","
.BI "pci_channel_state_t state "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "pdev" 12
pointer to PCI device.
.IP "state" 12
the current PCI connection state.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This routine is called from the PCI subsystem for error handling to device
with SLI-4 interface spec. This function is called by the PCI subsystem
after a PCI bus error affecting this device has been detected. When this
function is invoked, it will need to stop all the I/Os and interrupt(s)
to the device. Once that is done, it will return PCI_ERS_RESULT_NEED_RESET
for the PCI subsystem to perform proper recovery as desired.

Return codes
PCI_ERS_RESULT_NEED_RESET - need to reset before recovery
PCI_ERS_RESULT_DISCONNECT - device could not be recovered
