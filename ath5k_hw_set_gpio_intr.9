.SH NAME
ath5k_hw_set_gpio_intr \- Initialize the GPIO interrupt (RFKill switch)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" ath5k_hw_set_gpio_intr
.BI "(struct ath5k_hw *ah "  ","
.BI "unsigned int gpio "  ","
.BI "u32 interrupt_level "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "ah" 12
The \fIstruct ath5k_hw\fP
.IP "gpio" 12
The GPIO pin to use
.IP "interrupt_level" 12
True to generate interrupt on active pin (high)
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function is used to set up the GPIO interrupt for the hw RFKill switch.
That switch is connected to a GPIO pin and it's number is stored on EEPROM.
It can either open or close the circuit to indicate that we should disable
RF/Wireless to save power (we also get that from EEPROM).
