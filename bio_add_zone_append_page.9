.BI "unsigned int offset "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Attempt to add a page to the bio_vec maplist of a bio that will be submitted
for a zone-append request. This can fail for a number of reasons, such as the
bio being full or the target block device is not a zoned block device or
other limitations of the target block device. The target block device must
allow bio's up to PAGE_SIZE, so it is always possible to add a single page
to an empty bio.
.SH "RETURN"
number of bytes added to the bio, or 0 in case of a failure.
