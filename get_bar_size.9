.SH NAME
get_bar_size \- Get the address space consumed by a BAR
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "u64" get_bar_size
.BI "(u64 bar_val "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "bar_val" 12
Value that a BAR returned after -1 was written
to it.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function returns the size of the BAR, rounded up to 1
page.  It has to be rounded up because the hypervisor's page
table entry that maps the BAR into the VM can't specify an
offset within a page.  The invariant is that the hypervisor
must place any BARs of smaller than page length at the
beginning of a page.
.SH "RETURN"
Size in bytes of the consumed MMIO space.
