.SH "DESCRIPTION"

The ACPI tables are accessible after this, but the handling of events has not
been initialized and the global lock is not available yet, so AML should not
be executed at this point.

Doing this before switching the EFI runtime services to virtual mode allows
the EfiBootServices memory to be freed slightly earlier on boot.
