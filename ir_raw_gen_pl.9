.SH NAME
ir_raw_gen_pl \- Encode data to raw events with pulse-length modulation.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" ir_raw_gen_pl
.BI "(struct ir_raw_event **ev "  ","
.BI "unsigned int max "  ","
.BI "const struct ir_raw_timings_pl *timings "  ","
.BI "unsigned int n "  ","
.BI "u64 data "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "ev" 12
Pointer to pointer to next free event. *\fIev\fP is incremented for
each raw event filled.
.IP "max" 12
Maximum number of raw events to fill.
.IP "timings" 12
Pulse distance modulation timings.
.IP "n" 12
Number of bits of data.
.IP "data" 12
Data bits to encode.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Encodes the \fIn\fP least significant bits of \fIdata\fP using space-distance
modulation with the timing characteristics described by \fItimings\fP, writing up
to \fImax\fP raw IR events using the *\fIev\fP pointer.
.SH "RETURN"
0 on success.
-ENOBUFS if there isn't enough space in the array to fit the
full encoded data. In this case all \fImax\fP events will have been
written.
