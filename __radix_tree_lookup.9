.SH NAME
__radix_tree_lookup \- lookup an item in a radix tree
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void *" __radix_tree_lookup
.BI "(const struct radix_tree_root *root "  ","
.BI "unsigned long index "  ","
.BI "struct radix_tree_node **nodep "  ","
.BI "void __rcu ***slotp "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "root" 12
radix tree root
.IP "index" 12
index key
.IP "nodep" 12
returns node
.IP "slotp" 12
returns slot

Lookup and return the item at position \fIindex\fP in the radix
tree \fIroot\fP.

Until there is more than one item in the tree, no nodes are
allocated and \fIroot->xa_head\fP is used as a direct slot instead of
pointing to a node, in which case *\fInodep\fP will be NULL.
