.SH NAME
drm_atomic_helper_commit_modeset_disables \- modeset commit to disable outputs
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" drm_atomic_helper_commit_modeset_disables
.BI "(struct drm_device *dev "  ","
.BI "struct drm_atomic_state *old_state "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dev" 12
DRM device
.IP "old_state" 12
atomic state object with old state structures
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function shuts down all the outputs that need to be shut down and
prepares them (if required) with the new mode.

For compatibility with legacy CRTC helpers this should be called before
\fBdrm_atomic_helper_commit_planes\fP, which is what the default commit function
does. But drivers with different needs can group the modeset commits together
and do the plane commits at the end. This is useful for drivers doing runtime
PM since planes updates then only happen when the CRTC is actually enabled.
