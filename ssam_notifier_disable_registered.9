.SH NAME
ssam_notifier_disable_registered \- Disable events for all registered notifiers.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" ssam_notifier_disable_registered
.BI "(struct ssam_controller *ctrl "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "ctrl" 12
The controller for which to disable the notifiers/events.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Disables events for all currently registered notifiers. In case of an error
(EC command failing), all previously disabled events will be restored and
the error code returned.

This function is intended to disable all events prior to hibernation entry.
See \fBssam_notifier_restore_registered\fP to restore/re-enable all events
disabled with this function.

Note that this function will not disable events for notifiers registered
after calling this function. It should thus be made sure that no new
notifiers are going to be added after this call and before the corresponding
call to \fBssam_notifier_restore_registered\fP.
.SH "RETURN"
Returns zero on success. In case of failure returns the error code
returned by the failed EC command to disable an event.
