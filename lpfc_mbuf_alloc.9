.SH NAME
lpfc_mbuf_alloc \- Allocate an mbuf from the lpfc_mbuf_pool PCI pool
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void *" lpfc_mbuf_alloc
.BI "(struct lpfc_hba *phba "  ","
.BI "int mem_flags "  ","
.BI "dma_addr_t *handle "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "phba" 12
HBA which owns the pool to allocate from
.IP "mem_flags" 12
indicates if this is a priority (MEM_PRI) allocation
.IP "handle" 12
used to return the DMA-mapped address of the mbuf
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Allocates a DMA-mapped buffer from the lpfc_mbuf_pool PCI pool.
Allocates from generic dma_pool_alloc function first and if that fails and
mem_flags has MEM_PRI set (the only defined flag), returns an mbuf from the
HBA's pool.
.SH "NOTES"
Not interrupt-safe.  Must be called with no locks held.  Takes
phba->hbalock.
.SH "RETURN"
pointer to the allocated mbuf on success
NULL on failure
