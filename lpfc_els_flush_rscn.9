.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This routine cleans up any Registration State Change Notification
(RSCN) activity with a \fIvport\fP. Note that the fc_rscn_flush flag of the
\fIvport\fP together with the host_lock is used to prevent multiple thread
trying to access the RSCN array on a same \fIvport\fP at the same time.
