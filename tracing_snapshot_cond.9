.SH NAME
tracing_snapshot_cond \- conditionally take a snapshot of the current buffer.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" tracing_snapshot_cond
.BI "(struct trace_array *tr "  ","
.BI "void *cond_data "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "tr" 12
The tracing instance to snapshot
.IP "cond_data" 12
The data to be tested conditionally, and possibly saved
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This is the same as \fBtracing_snapshot\fP except that the snapshot is
conditional - the snapshot will only happen if the
cond_snapshot.\fBupdate\fP implementation receiving the cond_data
returns true, which means that the trace array's cond_snapshot
\fBupdate\fP operation used the cond_data to determine whether the
snapshot should be taken, and if it was, presumably saved it along
with the snapshot.
