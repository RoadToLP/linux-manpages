.SH NAME
ipa_mem_zero_modem \- Zero IPA-local memory regions owned by the modem
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" ipa_mem_zero_modem
.BI "(struct ipa *ipa "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS

IPA pointer
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Zero regions of IPA-local memory used by the modem.  These are configured
(and initially zeroed) by \fBipa_mem_setup\fP, but if the modem crashes and
restarts via SSR we need to re-initialize them.  A QMI message tells the
modem where to find regions of IPA local memory it needs to know about
(these included).
