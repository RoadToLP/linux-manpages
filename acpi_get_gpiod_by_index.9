.SH NAME
acpi_get_gpiod_by_index \- get a GPIO descriptor from device resources
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "struct gpio_desc *" acpi_get_gpiod_by_index
.BI "(struct acpi_device *adev "  ","
.BI "const char *propname "  ","
.BI "int index "  ","
.BI "struct acpi_gpio_info *info "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "adev" 12
pointer to a ACPI device to get GPIO from
.IP "propname" 12
Property name of the GPIO (optional)
.IP "index" 12
index of GpioIo/GpioInt resource (starting from 0)
.IP "info" 12
info pointer to fill in (optional)
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Function goes through ACPI resources for \fIadev\fP and based on \fIindex\fP looks
up a GpioIo/GpioInt resource, translates it to the Linux GPIO descriptor,
and returns it. \fIindex\fP matches GpioIo/GpioInt resources only so if there
are total 3 GPIO resources, the index goes from 0 to 2.

If \fIpropname\fP is specified the GPIO is looked using device property. In
that case \fIindex\fP is used to select the GPIO entry in the property value
(in case of multiple).

If the GPIO cannot be translated or there is an error, an ERR_PTR is
returned.
.SH "NOTE"
if the GPIO resource has multiple entries in the pin list, this
function only returns the first.
