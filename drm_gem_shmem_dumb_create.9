.BI "struct drm_device *dev "  ","
.BI "struct drm_mode_create_dumb *args "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function computes the pitch of the dumb buffer and rounds it up to an
integer number of bytes per pixel. Drivers for hardware that doesn't have
any additional restrictions on the pitch can directly use this function as
their \fIdrm_driver.dumb_create\fP callback.

For hardware with additional restrictions, drivers can adjust the fields
set up by userspace before calling into this function.
.SH "RETURN"
0 on success or a negative error code on failure.
