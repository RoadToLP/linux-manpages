.SH NAME
__starget_for_each_device \- helper to walk all devices of a target (UNLOCKED)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" __starget_for_each_device
.BI "(struct scsi_target *starget "  ","
.BI "void *data "  ","
.BI "void (*fn)(struct scsi_device *, void *) "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "starget" 12
target whose devices we want to iterate over.
.IP "data" 12
parameter for callback \fI\fP\fBfn\fP
.IP "fn" 12
callback function that is invoked for each device
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This traverses over each device of \fIstarget\fP.  It does _not_
take a reference on the scsi_device, so the whole loop must be
protected by shost->host_lock.
.SH "NOTE"
The only reason why drivers would want to use this is because
they need to access the device list in irq context.  Otherwise you
really want to use starget_for_each_device instead.
