.SH NAME
rt5682_sel_asrc_clk_src \- select ASRC clock source for a set of filters
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" rt5682_sel_asrc_clk_src
.BI "(struct snd_soc_component *component "  ","
.BI "unsigned int filter_mask "  ","
.BI "unsigned int clk_src "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "component" 12
SoC audio component device.
.IP "filter_mask" 12
mask of filters.
.IP "clk_src" 12
clock source
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The ASRC function is for asynchronous MCLK and LRCK. Also, since RT5682 can
only support standard 32fs or 64fs i2s format, ASRC should be enabled to
support special i2s clock format such as Intel's 100fs(100 * sampling rate).
ASRC function will track i2s clock and generate a corresponding system clock
for codec. This function provides an API to select the clock source for a
set of filters specified by the mask. And the component driver will turn on
ASRC for these filters if ASRC is selected as their clock source.
