.SH NAME
intel_runtime_pm_get_noresume \- grab a runtime pm reference
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "intel_wakeref_t" intel_runtime_pm_get_noresume
.BI "(struct intel_runtime_pm *rpm "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "rpm" 12
the intel_runtime_pm structure
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function grabs a device-level runtime pm reference (mostly used for GEM
code to ensure the GTT or GT is on).

It will _not_ power up the device but instead only check that it's powered
on.  Therefore it is only valid to call this functions from contexts where
the device is known to be powered up and where trying to power it up would
result in hilarity and deadlocks. That pretty much means only the system
suspend/resume code where this is used to grab runtime pm references for
delayed setup down in work items.

Any runtime pm reference obtained by this function must have a symmetric
call to \fBintel_runtime_pm_put\fP to release the reference again.
.SH "RETURN"
the wakeref cookie to pass to \fBintel_runtime_pm_put\fP
