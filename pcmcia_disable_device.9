.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBpcmcia_disable_device\fP is the driver-callable counterpart to
\fBpcmcia_enable_device\fP: If a PCMCIA device is no longer used,
drivers are expected to clean up and disable the device by calling
this function. Any I/O ranges (iomem and ioports) will be released,
the Vpp voltage will be set to 0, and IRQs will no longer be
generated -- at least if there is no other card function (of
multifunction devices) being used.
