.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "struct pwm_device *" pwm_get

.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dev" 12

.IP "con_id" 12

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Lookup is first attempted using DT. If the device was not instantiated from
a device tree, a PWM chip and a relative index is looked up via a table
supplied by board setup code (see \fBpwm_add_table\fP).

Once a PWM chip has been found the specified PWM device will be requested
and is ready to be used.
.SH "RETURN"
A pointer to the requested PWM device or an \fBERR_PTR\fP-encoded
error code on failure.
