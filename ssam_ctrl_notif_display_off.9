.SH NAME
ssam_ctrl_notif_display_off \- Notify EC that the display has been turned off.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" ssam_ctrl_notif_display_off
.BI "(struct ssam_controller *ctrl "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "ctrl" 12
The controller.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Notify the EC that the display has been turned off and the driver may enter
a lower-power state. This will prevent events from being sent directly.
Rather, the EC signals an event by pulling the wakeup GPIO high for as long
as there are pending events. The events then need to be manually released,
one by one, via the GPIO callback request. All pending events accumulated
during this state can also be released by issuing the display-on
notification, e.g. via \fBssam_ctrl_notif_display_on\fP, which will also reset
the GPIO.

On some devices, specifically ones with an integrated keyboard, the keyboard
backlight will be turned off by this call.

This function will only send the display-off notification command if
display notifications are supported by the EC. Currently all known devices
support these notifications.

Use \fBssam_ctrl_notif_display_on\fP to reverse the effects of this function.
.SH "RETURN"
Returns zero on success or if no request has been executed, the
status of the executed SAM request if that request failed, or -EPROTO if
an unexpected response has been received.
