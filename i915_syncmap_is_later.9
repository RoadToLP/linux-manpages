.SH NAME
i915_syncmap_is_later \- - compare against the last know sync point
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "bool" i915_syncmap_is_later
.BI "(struct i915_syncmap **root "  ","
.BI "u64 id "  ","
.BI "u32 seqno "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "root" 12
pointer to the #i915_syncmap
.IP "id" 12
the context id (other timeline) we are synchronising to
.IP "seqno" 12
the sequence number along the other timeline
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
If we have already synchronised this \fIroot\fP timeline with another (\fIid\fP) then
we can omit any repeated or earlier synchronisation requests. If the two
timelines are already coupled, we can also omit the dependency between the
two as that is already known via the timeline.

Returns true if the two timelines are already synchronised wrt to \fIseqno\fP,
false if not and the synchronisation must be emitted.
