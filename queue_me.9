.SH NAME
queue_me \- Enqueue the futex_q on the futex_hash_bucket
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" queue_me
.BI "(struct futex_q *q "  ","
.BI "struct futex_hash_bucket *hb "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "q" 12
The futex_q to enqueue
.IP "hb" 12
The destination hash bucket
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The hb->lock must be held by the caller, and is released here. A call to
\fBqueue_me\fP is typically paired with exactly one call to \fBunqueue_me\fP.  The
exceptions involve the PI related operations, which may use \fBunqueue_me_pi\fP
or nothing if the unqueue is done as part of the wake process and the unqueue
state is implicit in the state of woken task (see \fBfutex_wait_requeue_pi\fP for
an example).
