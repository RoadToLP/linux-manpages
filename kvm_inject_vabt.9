.SH NAME
kvm_inject_vabt \- inject an async abort / SError into the guest
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" kvm_inject_vabt
.BI "(struct kvm_vcpu *vcpu "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "vcpu" 12
The VCPU to receive the exception
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
It is assumed that this code is called from the VCPU thread and that the
VCPU therefore is not currently executing guest code.

Systems with the RAS Extensions specify an imp-def ESR (ISV/IDS = 1) with
the remaining ISS all-zeros so that this error is not interpreted as an
uncategorized RAS error. Without the RAS Extensions we can't specify an ESR
value, so the CPU generates an imp-def value.
