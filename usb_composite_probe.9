.SH NAME
usb_composite_probe \- register a composite driver
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" usb_composite_probe
.BI "(struct usb_composite_driver *driver "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "driver" 12
the driver to register
.SH "CONTEXT"
single threaded during gadget setup
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function is used to register drivers using the composite driver
framework.  The return value is zero, or a negative errno value.
Those values normally come from the driver's \fIbind\fP method, which does
all the work of setting up the driver to match the hardware.

On successful return, the gadget is ready to respond to requests from
the host, unless one of its components invokes \fBusb_gadget_disconnect\fP
while it was binding.  That would usually be done in order to wait for
some userspace participation.
