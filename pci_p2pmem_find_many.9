.SH NAME
pci_p2pmem_find_many \- find a peer-to-peer DMA memory device compatible with the specified list of clients and shortest distance (as determined by pci_p2pmem_dma())
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "struct pci_dev *" pci_p2pmem_find_many
.BI "(struct device **clients "  ","
.BI "int num_clients "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "clients" 12
array of devices to check (NULL-terminated)
.IP "num_clients" 12
number of client devices in the list
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
If multiple devices are behind the same switch, the one "closest" to the
client devices in use will be chosen first. (So if one of the providers is
the same as one of the clients, that provider will be used ahead of any
other providers that are unrelated). If multiple providers are an equal
distance away, one will be chosen at random.

Returns a pointer to the PCI device with a reference taken (use pci_dev_put
to return the reference) or NULL if no compatible device is found. The
found provider will also be assigned to the client list.
