.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "substream" 12
PCM substream
.IP "filter_fn" 12
Filter function used to request the DMA channel
.IP "filter_data" 12
Data passed to the DMA filter function
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Returns 0 on success, a negative error code otherwise.

This function will request a DMA channel using the passed filter function and
data. The function should usually be called from the pcm open callback. Note
that this function will use private_data field of the substream's runtime. So
it is not available to your pcm driver implementation.
