.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" ia64_set_curr_task
.BI "(int cpu "  ","
.BI "struct task_struct *p "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "cpu" 12
the processor in question.
.IP "p" 12
the task pointer to set.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function must only be used when non-maskable interrupts
are serviced on a separate stack. It allows the architecture to switch the
notion of the current task on a CPU in a non-blocking manner. This function
must be called with all CPU's synchronized, and interrupts disabled, the
and caller must save the original value of the current task (see
\fBcurr_task\fP above) and restore that value before reenabling interrupts and
re-starting the system.

ONLY VALID WHEN THE WHOLE SYSTEM IS STOPPED!
