.SH NAME
intel_pt_compare_buffers \- compare bytes in a buffer to a circular buffer.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "bool" intel_pt_compare_buffers
.BI "(void *buf1 "  ","
.BI "size_t compare_size "  ","
.BI "void *buf2 "  ","
.BI "size_t offs2 "  ","
.BI "size_t buf2_size "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "buf1" 12
first buffer
.IP "compare_size" 12
number of bytes to compare
.IP "buf2" 12
second buffer (a circular buffer)
.IP "offs2" 12
offset in second buffer
.IP "buf2_size" 12
size of second buffer
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The comparison allows for the possibility that the bytes to compare in the
circular buffer are not contiguous.  It is assumed that \fIcompare_size\fP <=
\fIbuf2_size\fP.  This function returns false if the bytes are identical, true
otherwise.
