.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Marking the IO PDIR entry(ies) as Invalid and invalidate
corresponding IO TLB entry. The Ike PCOM (Purge Command Register)
is to purge stale entries in the IO TLB when unmapping entries.

The PCOM register supports purging of multiple pages, with a minium
of 1 page and a maximum of 2GB. Hardware requires the address be
aligned to the size of the range being purged. The size of the range
must be a power of 2. The "Cool perf optimization" in the
allocation routine helps keep that true.
