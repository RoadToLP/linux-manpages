If the inode has been found through an idmapped mount the user namespace of
the vfsmount must be passed through \fImnt_userns\fP. This function will then
take care to map the inode according to \fImnt_userns\fP before checking
permissions. On non-idmapped mounts or if permission checking is to be
performed on the raw inode simply passs init_user_ns.
