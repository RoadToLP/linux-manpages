.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Tasks belonging to \fIsrc_cset\fP are about to be migrated to \fIdst_cgrp\fP.  Pin
\fIsrc_cset\fP and add it to \fImgctx->src_csets\fP, which should later be cleaned
up by \fBcgroup_migrate_finish\fP.

This function may be called without holding cgroup_threadgroup_rwsem
even if the target is a process.  Threads may be created and destroyed
but as long as cgroup_mutex is not dropped, no new css_set can be put
into play and the preloaded css_sets are guaranteed to cover all
migrations.
