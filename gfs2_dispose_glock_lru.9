.SH NAME
gfs2_dispose_glock_lru \- Demote a list of glocks
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" gfs2_dispose_glock_lru
.BI "(struct list_head *list "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "list" 12
The list to dispose of
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Disposing of glocks may involve disk accesses, so that here we sort
the glocks by number (i.e. disk location of the inodes) so that if
there are any such accesses, they'll be sent in order (mostly).

Must be called under the lru_lock, but may drop and retake this
lock. While the lru_lock is dropped, entries may vanish from the
list, but no new entries will appear on the list (since it is
private)
