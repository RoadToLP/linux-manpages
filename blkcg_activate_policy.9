.SH NAME
blkcg_activate_policy \- activate a blkcg policy on a request_queue
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" blkcg_activate_policy
.BI "(struct request_queue *q "  ","
.BI "const struct blkcg_policy *pol "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "q" 12
request_queue of interest
.IP "pol" 12
blkcg policy to activate
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Activate \fIpol\fP on \fIq\fP.  Requires GFP_KERNEL context.  \fIq\fP goes through
bypass mode to populate its blkgs with policy_data for \fIpol\fP.

Activation happens with \fIq\fP bypassed, so nobody would be accessing blkgs
from IO path.  Update of each blkg is protected by both queue and blkcg
locks so that holding either lock and testing \fBblkcg_policy_enabled\fP is
always enough for dereferencing policy data.

The caller is responsible for synchronizing [de]activations and policy
[un]registerations.  Returns 0 on success, -errno on failure.
