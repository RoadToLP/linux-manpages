.SH NAME
assoc_array_destroy \- Destroy an associative array
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" assoc_array_destroy
.BI "(struct assoc_array *array "  ","
.BI "const struct assoc_array_ops *ops "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "array" 12
The array to destroy.
.IP "ops" 12
The operations to use.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Discard all metadata and free all objects in an associative array.  The
array will be empty and ready to use again upon completion.  This function
cannot fail.

The caller must prevent all other accesses whilst this takes place as no
attempt is made to adjust pointers gracefully to permit RCU readlock-holding
accesses to continue.  On the other hand, no memory allocation is required.
