.SH NAME
drm_dp_dual_mode_get_tmds_output \- Get the state of the TMDS output buffers in the DP dual mode adaptor
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" drm_dp_dual_mode_get_tmds_output
.BI "(enum drm_dp_dual_mode_type type "  ","
.BI "struct i2c_adapter *adapter "  ","
.BI "bool *enabled "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "type" 12
DP dual mode adaptor type
.IP "adapter" 12
I2C adapter for the DDC bus
.IP "enabled" 12
current state of the TMDS output buffers
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Get the state of the TMDS output buffers in the adaptor. For
type2 adaptors this is queried from the DP_DUAL_MODE_TMDS_OEN
register. As some type 1 adaptors have problems with registers
(see comments in \fBdrm_dp_dual_mode_detect\fP) we don't read the
register on those, instead we simply assume that the buffers
are always enabled.
.SH "RETURN"
0 on success, negative error code on failure
