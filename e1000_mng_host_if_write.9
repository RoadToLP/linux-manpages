.B "s32" e1000_mng_host_if_write
.BI "(struct e1000_hw *hw "  ","
.BI "u8 *buffer "  ","
.BI "u16 length "  ","
.BI "u16 offset "  ","
.BI "u8 *sum "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "hw" 12
pointer to the HW structure
.IP "buffer" 12
pointer to the host interface buffer
.IP "length" 12
size of the buffer
.IP "offset" 12
location in the buffer to write to
.IP "sum" 12
sum of the data (not checksum)

This function writes the buffer content at the offset given on the host if.
It also does alignment considerations to do the writes in most efficient
way.  Also fills up the sum of the buffer in *buffer parameter.
