.SH NAME
isolate_lru_page \- tries to isolate a page from its LRU list
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" isolate_lru_page
.BI "(struct page *page "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "page" 12
page to isolate from its LRU list
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Isolates a \fIpage\fP from an LRU list, clears PageLRU and adjusts the
vmstat statistic corresponding to whatever LRU list the page was on.

Returns 0 if the page was removed from an LRU list.
Returns -EBUSY if the page was not on an LRU list.

The returned page will have \fBPageLRU\fP cleared.  If it was found on
the active list, it will have PageActive set.  If it was found on
the unevictable list, it will have the PageUnevictable bit set. That flag
may need to be cleared by the caller before letting the page go.

The vmstat statistic corresponding to the list on which the page was
found will be decremented.

Restrictions:

(1) Must be called with an elevated refcount on the page. This is a
fundamental difference from isolate_lru_pages (which is called
without a stable reference).
(2) the lru_lock must not be held.
(3) interrupts must be enabled.
