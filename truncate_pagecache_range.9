.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function should typically be called before the filesystem
releases resources associated with the freed range (eg. deallocates
blocks). This way, pagecache will always stay logically coherent
with on-disk format, and the filesystem would not have to deal with
situations such as writepage being called for a page that has already
had its underlying blocks deallocated.
