.SH NAME
batadv_mcast_bridge_log \- debug output for topology changes in bridged setups
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" batadv_mcast_bridge_log
.BI "(struct batadv_priv *bat_priv "  ","
.BI "struct batadv_mcast_mla_flags *new_flags "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "bat_priv" 12
the bat priv with all the soft interface information
.IP "new_flags" 12
flags indicating the new multicast state
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
If no bridges are ever used on this node, then this function does nothing.

Otherwise this function outputs debug information to the 'mcast' log level
which might be relevant to our multicast optimizations.

More precisely, it outputs information when a bridge interface is added or
removed from a soft interface. And when a bridge is present, it further
outputs information about the querier state which is relevant for the
multicast flags this node is going to set.
