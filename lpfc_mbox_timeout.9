.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This is the callback function for mailbox timer. The mailbox
timer is armed when a new mailbox command is issued and the timer
is deleted when the mailbox complete. The function is called by
the kernel timer code when a mailbox does not complete within
expected time. This function wakes up the worker thread to
process the mailbox timeout and returns. All the processing is
done by the worker thread function lpfc_mbox_timeout_handler.
