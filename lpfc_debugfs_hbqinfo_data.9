.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This routine dumps the host buffer queue info from the \fIphba\fP to \fIbuf\fP up to
\fIsize\fP number of bytes. A header that describes the current hbq state will be
dumped to \fIbuf\fP first and then info on each hbq entry will be dumped to \fIbuf\fP
until \fIsize\fP bytes have been dumped or all the hbq info has been dumped.

Return Value:
This routine returns the amount of bytes that were dumped into \fIbuf\fP and will
not exceed \fIsize\fP.
.SH "NOTES"
This routine will rotate through each configured HBQ each time called.
