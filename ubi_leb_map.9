.SH NAME
ubi_leb_map \- map logical eraseblock to a physical eraseblock.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" ubi_leb_map
.BI "(struct ubi_volume_desc *desc "  ","
.BI "int lnum "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "desc" 12
volume descriptor
.IP "lnum" 12
logical eraseblock number
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function maps an un-mapped logical eraseblock \fIlnum\fP to a physical
eraseblock. This means, that after a successful invocation of this
function the logical eraseblock \fIlnum\fP will be empty (contain only 0xFF
bytes) and be mapped to a physical eraseblock, even if an unclean reboot
happens.

This function returns zero in case of success, -EBADF if the volume is
damaged because of an interrupted update, -EBADMSG if the logical
eraseblock is already mapped, and other negative error codes in case of
other failures.
