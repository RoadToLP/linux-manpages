.SH NAME
drm_client_buffer_vmap \- Map DRM client buffer into address space
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" drm_client_buffer_vmap
.BI "(struct drm_client_buffer *buffer "  ","
.BI "struct dma_buf_map *map_copy "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "buffer" 12
DRM client buffer
.IP "map_copy" 12
Returns the mapped memory's address
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function maps a client buffer into kernel address space. If the
buffer is already mapped, it returns the existing mapping's address.

Client buffer mappings are not ref'counted. Each call to
\fBdrm_client_buffer_vmap\fP should be followed by a call to
\fBdrm_client_buffer_vunmap\fP; or the client buffer should be mapped
throughout its lifetime.

The returned address is a copy of the internal value. In contrast to
other vmap interfaces, you don't need it for the client's vunmap
function. So you can modify it at will during blit and draw operations.
.SH "RETURN"
0 on success, or a negative errno code otherwise.
