.SH NAME
drm_dp_dual_mode_max_tmds_clock \- Max TMDS clock for DP dual mode adaptor
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" drm_dp_dual_mode_max_tmds_clock
.BI "(enum drm_dp_dual_mode_type type "  ","
.BI "struct i2c_adapter *adapter "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "type" 12
DP dual mode adaptor type
.IP "adapter" 12
I2C adapter for the DDC bus
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Determine the max TMDS clock the adaptor supports based on the
type of the dual mode adaptor and the DP_DUAL_MODE_MAX_TMDS_CLOCK
register (on type2 adaptors). As some type 1 adaptors have
problems with registers (see comments in \fBdrm_dp_dual_mode_detect\fP)
we don't read the register on those, instead we simply assume
a 165 MHz limit based on the specification.
.SH "RETURN"
Maximum supported TMDS clock rate for the DP dual mode adaptor in kHz.
