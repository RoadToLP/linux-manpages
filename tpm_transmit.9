.SH "DESCRIPTION"
A wrapper around \fBtpm_try_transmit\fP that handles TPM2_RC_RETRY returns from
the TPM and retransmits the command after a delay up to a maximum wait of
TPM2_DURATION_LONG.

Note that TPM 1.x never returns TPM2_RC_RETRY so the retry logic is TPM 2.0
only.

* The response length        - OK
* -errno                     - A system error
