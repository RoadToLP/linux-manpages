.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function creates a kset structure dynamically.  This structure can
then be registered with the system and show up in sysfs with a call to
\fBkset_register\fP.  When you are finished with this structure, if
\fBkset_register\fP has been called, call \fBkset_unregister\fP and the
structure will be dynamically freed when it is no longer being used.

If the kset was not able to be created, NULL will be returned.
