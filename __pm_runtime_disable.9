.SH NAME
__pm_runtime_disable \- Disable runtime PM of a device.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" __pm_runtime_disable
.BI "(struct device *dev "  ","
.BI "bool check_resume "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dev" 12
Device to handle.
.IP "check_resume" 12
If set, check if there's a resume request for the device.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Increment power.disable_depth for the device and if it was zero previously,
cancel all pending runtime PM requests for the device and wait for all
operations in progress to complete.  The device can be either active or
suspended after its runtime PM has been disabled.

If \fIcheck_resume\fP is set and there's a resume request pending when
\fB__pm_runtime_disable\fP is called and power.disable_depth is zero, the
function will wake up the device before disabling its runtime PM.
