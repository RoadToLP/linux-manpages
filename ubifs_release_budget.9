.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function releases the space budgeted by '\fBubifs_budget_space\fP'. Note,
since the index changes (which were budgeted for in \fIreq->idx_growth\fP) will
only be written to the media on commit, this function moves the index budget
from \fIc->bi.idx_growth\fP to \fIc->bi.uncommitted_idx\fP. The latter will be zeroed
by the commit operation.
