'peer' to create and add to peer_list of serial
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Adds a 'peer' (ie, a local or remote 'serial' unit device) to the list of
peers for a specific fw_card. Optionally, auto-attach this peer to an
available tty port. This function is called either directly or indirectly
as a result of a 'serial' unit device being created & probed.

A 1:1 correspondence between an fw_unit and an fwtty_peer is maintained
via the \fBdev_set_drvdata\fP for the device of the fw_unit.
.SH "NOTE"
this function is serialized with \fBfwserial_remove_peer\fP by the
fwserial_list_mutex held in \fBfwserial_probe\fP.
