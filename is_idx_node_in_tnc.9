.SH NAME
is_idx_node_in_tnc \- determine if an index node is in the TNC.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" is_idx_node_in_tnc
.BI "(struct ubifs_info *c "  ","
.BI "union ubifs_key *key "  ","
.BI "int level "  ","
.BI "int lnum "  ","
.BI "int offs "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "c" 12
UBIFS file-system description object
.IP "key" 12
key of index node
.IP "level" 12
index node level
.IP "lnum" 12
LEB number of index node
.IP "offs" 12
offset of index node
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function returns 0 if the index node is not referred to in the TNC, 1
if the index node is referred to in the TNC and the corresponding znode is
dirty, 2 if an index node is referred to in the TNC and the corresponding
znode is clean, and a negative error code in case of failure.

Note, the \fIkey\fP argument has to be the key of the first child. Also note,
this function relies on the fact that 0:0 is never a valid LEB number and
offset for a main-area node.
