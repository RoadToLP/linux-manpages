The FCoE Controller that is being enabled or disabled
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
fcoe_sysfs will ensure that the state of 'enabled' has
changed, so no checking is necessary here. This routine simply
calls fcoe_enable or fcoe_disable, both of which are deprecated.
When those routines are removed the functionality can be merged
here.
