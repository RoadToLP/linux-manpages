.SH NAME
acpi_dev_pm_get_state \- Get preferred power state of ACPI device.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" acpi_dev_pm_get_state
.BI "(struct device *dev "  ","
.BI "struct acpi_device *adev "  ","
.BI "u32 target_state "  ","
.BI "int *d_min_p "  ","
.BI "int *d_max_p "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dev" 12
Device whose preferred target power state to return.
.IP "adev" 12
ACPI device node corresponding to \fIdev\fP.
.IP "target_state" 12
System state to match the resultant device state.
.IP "d_min_p" 12
Location to store the highest power state available to the device.
.IP "d_max_p" 12
Location to store the lowest power state available to the device.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Find the lowest power (highest number) and highest power (lowest number) ACPI
device power states that the device can be in while the system is in the
state represented by \fItarget_state\fP.  Store the integer numbers representing
those stats in the memory locations pointed to by \fId_max_p\fP and \fId_min_p\fP,
respectively.

Callers must ensure that \fIdev\fP and \fIadev\fP are valid pointers and that \fIadev\fP
actually corresponds to \fIdev\fP before using this function.

Returns 0 on success or -ENODATA when one of the ACPI methods fails or
returns a value that doesn't make sense.  The memory locations pointed to by
\fId_max_p\fP and \fId_min_p\fP are only modified on success.
