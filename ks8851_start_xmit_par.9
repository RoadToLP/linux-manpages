.SH NAME
ks8851_start_xmit_par \- transmit packet
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "netdev_tx_t" ks8851_start_xmit_par
.BI "(struct sk_buff *skb "  ","
.BI "struct net_device *dev "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "skb" 12
The buffer to transmit
.IP "dev" 12
The device used to transmit the packet.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Called by the network layer to transmit the \fIskb\fP. Queue the packet for
the device and schedule the necessary work to transmit the packet when
it is free.

We do this to firstly avoid sleeping with the network device locked,
and secondly so we can round up more than one packet to transmit which
means we can try and avoid generating too many transmit done interrupts.
