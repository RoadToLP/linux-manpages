.SH "DESCRIPTION"
TCP: If the remote end dropped the connection, delay reconnecting.

UDP socket connects are synchronous, but we use a work queue anyway
to guarantee that even unprivileged user processes can set up a
socket on a privileged port.

If a UDP socket connect fails, the delay behavior here prevents
retry floods (hard mounts).
