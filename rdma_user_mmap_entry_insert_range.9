.IP "entry" 12
the entry to insert into the mmap_xa
.IP "length" 12

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function should be called by drivers that use the rdma_user_mmap
interface for implementing their mmap syscall A database of mmap offsets is
handled in the core and helper functions are provided to insert entries
into the database and extract entries when the user calls mmap with the
given offset. The function allocates a unique page offset in a given range
that should be provided to user, the user will use the offset to retrieve
information such as address to be mapped and how.
.SH "RETURN"
0 on success and -ENOMEM on failure
