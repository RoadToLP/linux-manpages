.SH NAME
drm_bridge_connector_init \- Initialise a connector for a chain of bridges
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "struct drm_connector *" drm_bridge_connector_init
.BI "(struct drm_device *drm "  ","
.BI "struct drm_encoder *encoder "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "drm" 12
the DRM device
.IP "encoder" 12
the encoder where the bridge chain starts
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Allocate, initialise and register a \fIdrm_bridge_connector\fP with the \fIdrm\fP
device. The connector is associated with a chain of bridges that starts at
the \fIencoder\fP. All bridges in the chain shall report bridge operation flags
(\fIdrm_bridge->ops\fP) and bridge output type (\fIdrm_bridge->type\fP), and none of
them may create a DRM connector directly.

Returns a pointer to the new connector on success, or a negative error
pointer otherwise.
