.SH "DESCRIPTION"
If the inode has been created through an idmapped mount the user namespace of
the vfsmount must be passed through \fImnt_userns\fP. This function will then take
care to map the inode according to \fImnt_userns\fP before checking permissions
and initializing i_uid and i_gid. On non-idmapped mounts or if permission
checking is to be performed on the raw inode simply passs init_user_ns.
