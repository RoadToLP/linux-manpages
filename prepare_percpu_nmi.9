Interrupt line to prepare for NMI delivery

This call prepares an interrupt line to deliver NMI on the current CPU,
before that interrupt line gets enabled with \fBenable_percpu_nmi\fP.

As a CPU local operation, this should be called from non-preemptible
context.

If the interrupt line cannot be used to deliver NMIs, function
will fail returning a negative value.
