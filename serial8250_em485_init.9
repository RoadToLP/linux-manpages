.SH NAME
serial8250_em485_init \- put uart_8250_port into rs485 emulating
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" serial8250_em485_init
.BI "(struct uart_8250_port *p "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "p" 12
uart_8250_port port instance

The function is used to start rs485 software emulating on the
\fIstruct uart_8250_port\fP* \fIp\fP. Namely, RTS is switched before/after
transmission. The function is idempotent, so it is safe to call it
multiple times.

The caller MUST enable interrupt on empty shift register before
calling \fBserial8250_em485_init\fP. This interrupt is not a part of
8250 standard, but implementation defined.

The function is supposed to be called from .rs485_config callback
or from any other callback protected with p->port.lock spinlock.

See also \fBserial8250_em485_destroy\fP

Return 0 - success, -errno - otherwise
