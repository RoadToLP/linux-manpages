sdhci_arasan_update_baseclkfreq \- Set corecfg_baseclkfreq
.SH SYNOPSIS

.BI "(struct sdhci_host *host "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "host" 12
The sdhci_host
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The corecfg_baseclkfreq is supposed to contain the MHz of clk_xin.  This
function can be used to make that happen.
.SH "NOTES"
- Many existing devices don't seem to do this and work fine.  To keep
compatibility for old hardware where the device tree doesn't provide a
register map, this function is a noop if a soc_ctl_map hasn't been provided
for this platform.
- It's assumed that clk_xin is not dynamic and that we use the SDHCI divider
to achieve lower clock rates.  That means that this function is called once
at probe time and never called again.
