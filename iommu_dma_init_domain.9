.SH NAME
iommu_dma_init_domain \- Initialise a DMA mapping domain
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" iommu_dma_init_domain
.BI "(struct iommu_domain *domain "  ","
.BI "dma_addr_t base "  ","
.BI "u64 size "  ","
.BI "struct device *dev "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "domain" 12
IOMMU domain previously prepared by \fBiommu_get_dma_cookie\fP
.IP "base" 12
IOVA at which the mappable address space starts
.IP "size" 12
Size of IOVA space
.IP "dev" 12
Device the domain is being initialised for
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fIbase\fP and \fIsize\fP should be exact multiples of IOMMU page granularity to
avoid rounding surprises. If necessary, we reserve the page at address 0
to ensure it is an invalid IOVA. It is safe to reinitialise a domain, but
any change which could make prior IOVAs invalid will fail.
