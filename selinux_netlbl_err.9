the packet
.IP "family" 12
-- undescribed --
.IP "error" 12
the error code
.IP "gateway" 12

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
When a packet is dropped due to a call to \fBavc_has_perm\fP pass the error
code to the NetLabel subsystem so any protocol specific processing can be
done.  This is safe to call even if you are unsure if NetLabel labeling is
present on the packet, NetLabel is smart enough to only act when it should.
