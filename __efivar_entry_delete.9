.SH NAME
__efivar_entry_delete \- delete an EFI variable
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" __efivar_entry_delete
.BI "(struct efivar_entry *entry "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "entry" 12
entry containing EFI variable to delete
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Delete the variable from the firmware but leave \fIentry\fP on the
variable list.

This function differs from \fBefivar_entry_delete\fP because it does
not remove \fIentry\fP from the variable list. Also, it is safe to be
called from within a \fBefivar_entry_iter_begin\fP and
\fBefivar_entry_iter_end\fP region, unlike \fBefivar_entry_delete\fP.

Returns 0 on success, or a converted EFI status code if
\fBset_variable\fP fails.
