.SH NAME
drm_send_event \- send DRM event to file descriptor
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" drm_send_event
.BI "(struct drm_device *dev "  ","
.BI "struct drm_pending_event *e "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dev" 12
DRM device
.IP "e" 12
DRM event to deliver
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function sends the event \fIe\fP, initialized with \fBdrm_event_reserve_init\fP,
to its associated userspace DRM file. This function acquires
\fIdrm_device.event_lock\fP, see \fBdrm_send_event_locked\fP for callers which already
hold this lock.

Note that the core will take care of unlinking and disarming events when the
corresponding DRM file is closed. Drivers need not worry about whether the
DRM file for this event still exists and can call this function upon
completion of the asynchronous work unconditionally.
