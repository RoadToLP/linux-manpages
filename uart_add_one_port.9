.BI "(struct uart_driver *drv "  ","
.BI "struct uart_port *uport "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS

pointer to the uart low level driver structure for this port
.IP "uport" 12
uart port structure to use for this port.
.SH "CONTEXT"
task context, might sleep

This allows the driver to register its own uart_port structure
with the core driver.  The main purpose is to allow the low
level uart drivers to expand uart_port, rather than having yet
more levels of structures.
