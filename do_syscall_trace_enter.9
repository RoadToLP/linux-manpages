.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Performs various types of tracing on syscall entry. This includes seccomp,
ptrace, syscall tracepoints and audit.

The pt_regs are potentially visible to userspace via ptrace, so their
contents is ABI.

One or more of the tracers may modify the contents of pt_regs, in particular
to modify arguments or even the syscall number itself.

It's also possible that a tracer can choose to reject the system call. In
that case this function will return an illegal syscall number, and will put
an appropriate return value in regs->r3.
.SH "RETURN"
the (possibly changed) syscall number.
