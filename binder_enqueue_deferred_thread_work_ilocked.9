.BI "struct binder_work *work "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "thread" 12
thread to queue work to
.IP "work" 12
struct binder_work to add to list
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Adds the work to the todo list of the thread. Doesn't set the process_todo
flag, which means that (if it wasn't already set) the thread will go to
sleep without handling this work when it calls read.

Requires the proc->inner_lock to be held.
