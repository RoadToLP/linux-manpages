ib_device_set_netdev \- Associate the ib_dev with an underlying net_device
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" ib_device_set_netdev
.BI "(struct ib_device *ib_dev "  ","
.BI "struct net_device *ndev "  ","
.BI "unsigned int port "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "ib_dev" 12
Device to modify
.IP "ndev" 12
net_device to affiliate, may be NULL
.IP "port" 12
IB port the net_device is connected to
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Drivers should use this to link the ib_device to a netdev so the netdev
shows up in interfaces like ib_enum_roce_netdev. Only one netdev may be
affiliated with any port.

The caller must ensure that the given ndev is not unregistered or
unregistering, and that either the ib_device is unregistered or
\fBib_device_set_netdev\fP is called with NULL when the ndev sends a
NETDEV_UNREGISTER event.
