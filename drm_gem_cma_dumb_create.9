.SH NAME
drm_gem_cma_dumb_create \- create a dumb buffer object
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" drm_gem_cma_dumb_create
.BI "(struct drm_file *file_priv "  ","
.BI "struct drm_device *drm "  ","
.BI "struct drm_mode_create_dumb *args "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "file_priv" 12
DRM file-private structure to create the dumb buffer for
.IP "drm" 12
DRM device
.IP "args" 12
IOCTL data
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function computes the pitch of the dumb buffer and rounds it up to an
integer number of bytes per pixel. Drivers for hardware that doesn't have
any additional restrictions on the pitch can directly use this function as
their \fIdrm_driver.dumb_create\fP callback.

For hardware with additional restrictions, drivers can adjust the fields
set up by userspace and pass the IOCTL data along to the
\fBdrm_gem_cma_dumb_create_internal\fP function.
.SH "RETURN"
0 on success or a negative error code on failure.
