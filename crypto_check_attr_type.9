.SH NAME
crypto_check_attr_type \- check algorithm type and compute inherited mask
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" crypto_check_attr_type
.BI "(struct rtattr **tb "  ","
.BI "u32 type "  ","
.BI "u32 *mask_ret "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "tb" 12
the template parameters
.IP "type" 12
the algorithm type the template would be instantiated as
.IP "mask_ret" 12
(output) the mask that should be passed to crypto_grab_*()
to restrict the flags of any inner algorithms
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Validate that the algorithm type the user requested is compatible with the
one the template would actually be instantiated as.  E.g., if the user is
doing crypto_alloc_shash("cbc(aes)", ...), this would return an error because
the "cbc" template creates an "skcipher" algorithm, not an "shash" algorithm.

Also compute the mask to use to restrict the flags of any inner algorithms.
.SH "RETURN"
0 on success; -errno on failure
