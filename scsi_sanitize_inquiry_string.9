.SH NAME
scsi_sanitize_inquiry_string \- remove non-graphical chars from an INQUIRY result string
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" scsi_sanitize_inquiry_string
.BI "(unsigned char *s "  ","
.BI "int len "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "s" 12
INQUIRY result string to sanitize
.IP "len" 12
length of the string
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The SCSI spec says that INQUIRY vendor, product, and revision
strings must consist entirely of graphic ASCII characters,
padded on the right with spaces.  Since not all devices obey
this rule, we will replace non-graphic or non-ASCII characters
with spaces.  Exception: a NUL character is interpreted as a
string terminator, so all the following characters are set to
spaces.
