.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Requests common resource using the admin queue commands (0x0008).
When attempting to acquire the Global Config Lock, the driver can
learn of three states:
1) ICE_SUCCESS -        acquired lock, and can perform download package
2) ICE_ERR_AQ_ERROR -   did not get lock, driver should fail to load
3) ICE_ERR_AQ_NO_WORK - did not get lock, but another driver has
successfully downloaded the package; the driver does
not have to download the package and can continue
loading

Note that if the caller is in an acquire lock, perform action, release lock
phase of operation, it is possible that the FW may detect a timeout and issue
a CORER. In this case, the driver will receive a CORER interrupt and will
have to determine its cause. The calling thread that is handling this flow
will likely get an error propagated back to it indicating the Download
Package, Update Package or the Release Resource AQ commands timed out.
