prepare_kernel_cred \- Prepare a set of credentials for a kernel service
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "struct cred *" prepare_kernel_cred
.BI "(struct task_struct *daemon "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "daemon" 12
A userspace daemon to be used as a reference
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Prepare a set of credentials for a kernel service.  This can then be used to
override a task's own credentials so that work can be done on behalf of that
task that requires a different subjective context.

\fIdaemon\fP is used to provide a base for the security record, but can be NULL.
If \fIdaemon\fP is supplied, then the security data will be derived from that;
otherwise they'll be set to 0 and no groups, full capabilities and no keys.

The caller may change these controls afterwards if desired.

Returns the new credentials or NULL if out of memory.
