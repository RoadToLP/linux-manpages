.SH NAME
drm_color_ctm_s31_32_to_qm_n \- 
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "u64" drm_color_ctm_s31_32_to_qm_n
.BI "(u64 user_input "  ","
.BI "u32 m "  ","
.BI "u32 n "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "user_input" 12
input value
.IP "m" 12
number of integer bits, only support m <= 32, include the sign-bit
.IP "n" 12
number of fractional bits, only support n <= 32
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Convert and clamp S31.32 sign-magnitude to Qm.n (signed 2's complement).
The sign-bit BIT(m+n-1) and above are 0 for positive value and 1 for negative
the range of value is [-2^(m-1), 2^(m-1) - 2^-n]

For example
A Q3.12 format number:
- required bit: 3 + 12 = 15bits
- range: [-2^2, 2^2 - 2^âˆ’15]
.SH "NOTE"
the m can be zero if all bit_precision are used to present fractional
bits like Q0.32
