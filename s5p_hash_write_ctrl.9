.SH SYNOPSIS

.BI "(struct s5p_aes_dev *dd "  ","
.BI "size_t length "  ","
.BI "bool final "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dd" 12
secss device
.IP "length" 12
length for request
.IP "final" 12
true if final op
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Prepare SSS HASH block for processing bytes in DMA mode. If it is called
after previous updates, fill up IV words. For final, calculate and set
lengths for HASH so SecSS can finalize hash. For partial, set SSS HASH
length as 2^63 so it will be never reached and set to zero prelow and
prehigh.

This function does not start DMA transfer.
