.SH NAME
blk_lld_busy \- Check if underlying low-level drivers of a device are busy
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" blk_lld_busy
.BI "(struct request_queue *q "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "q" 12
the queue of the device being checked
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Check if underlying low-level drivers of a device are busy.
If the drivers want to export their busy state, they must set own
exporting function using \fBblk_queue_lld_busy\fP first.

Basically, this function is used only by request stacking drivers
to stop dispatching requests to underlying devices when underlying
devices are busy.  This behavior helps more I/O merging on the queue
of the request stacking driver and prevents I/O throughput regression
on burst I/O load.
.SH "RETURN"
0 - Not busy (The request stacking driver should dispatch request)
1 - Busy (The request stacking driver should stop dispatching request)
