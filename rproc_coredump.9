.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function will generate an ELF header for the registered segments
and create a devcoredump device associated with rproc. Based on the
coredump configuration this function will directly copy the segments
from device memory to userspace or copy segments from device memory to
a separate buffer, which can then be read by userspace.
The first approach avoids using extra vmalloc memory. But it will stall
recovery flow until dump is read by userspace.
