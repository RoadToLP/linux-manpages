.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This routine walks the list of nvme buffers that have been allocated and
repost them to the port by using SGL block post. This is needed after a
pci_function_reset/warm_start or start. The lpfc_hba_down_post_s4 routine
is responsible for moving all nvme buffers on the lpfc_abts_nvme_sgl_list
to the lpfc_io_buf_list. If the repost fails, reject all nvme buffers.
.SH "RETURN"
0 = success, non-zero failure.
