.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBpcmcia_release_configuration\fP is the 1:1 counterpart to
\fBpcmcia_enable_device\fP: If a PCMCIA device is no longer used by any
driver, the Vpp voltage is set to 0, IRQs will no longer be generated,
and I/O ranges will be disabled. As \fBpcmcia_release_io\fP and
\fBpcmcia_release_window\fP still need to be called, device drivers are
expected to call \fBpcmcia_disable_device\fP instead.
