.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "hw" 12
pointer to the HW structure

The defaults for 82575 and 82576 should be in the range of 50us to 50ms,
however the hardware default for these parts is 500us to 1ms which is less
than the 10ms recommended by the pci-e spec.  To address this we need to
increase the value to either 10ms to 200ms for capability version 1 config,
or 16ms to 55ms for version 2.
