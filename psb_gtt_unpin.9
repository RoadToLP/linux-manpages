.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gt" 12
range to pin

Undoes the effect of psb_gtt_pin. On the last drop the GEM object
will be removed from the GTT which will also drop the page references
and allow the VM to clean up or page stuff.

Non GEM backed objects treat this as a no-op as they are always GTT
backed objects.
