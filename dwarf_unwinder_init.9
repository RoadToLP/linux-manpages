.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Build the data structures describing the .dwarf_frame section to
make it easier to lookup CIE and FDE entries. Because the
\&.eh_frame section is packed as tightly as possible it is not
easy to lookup the FDE for a given PC, so we build a list of FDE
and CIE entries that make it easier.
