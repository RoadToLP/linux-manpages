.SH NAME
spi_nor_try_unlock_all \- Tries to unlock the entire flash memory array.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" spi_nor_try_unlock_all
.BI "(struct spi_nor *nor "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "nor" 12
pointer to a 'struct spi_nor'.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Some SPI NOR flashes are write protected by default after a power-on reset
cycle, in order to avoid inadvertent writes during power-up. Backward
compatibility imposes to unlock the entire flash memory array at power-up
by default.

Unprotecting the entire flash array will fail for boards which are hardware
write-protected. Thus any errors are ignored.
