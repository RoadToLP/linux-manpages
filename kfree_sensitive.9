.SH NAME
kfree_sensitive \- Clear sensitive information in memory before freeing
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" kfree_sensitive
.BI "(const void *p "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "p" 12
object to free memory of
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The memory of the object \fIp\fP points to is zeroed before freed.
If \fIp\fP is NULL, \fBkfree_sensitive\fP does nothing.
.SH "NOTE"
this function zeroes the whole allocated buffer which can be a good
deal bigger than the requested buffer size passed to \fBkmalloc\fP. So be
careful when using this function in performance sensitive code.
