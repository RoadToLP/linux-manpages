.SH NAME
acpi_os_unmap_iomem \- Drop a memory mapping reference.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void __ref" acpi_os_unmap_iomem
.BI "(void __iomem *virt "  ","
.BI "acpi_size size "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "virt" 12
Start of the address range to drop a reference to.
.IP "size" 12
Size of the address range to drop a reference to.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Look up the given virtual address range in the list of existing ACPI memory
mappings, drop a reference to it and if there are no more active references
to it, queue it up for later removal.

During early init (when acpi_permanent_mmap has not been set yet) this
routine simply calls \fB__acpi_unmap_table\fP to get the job done.  Since
\fB__acpi_unmap_table\fP is an __init function, the __ref annotation is needed
here.
