.SH NAME
__cpufreq_cooling_register \- helper function to create cpufreq cooling device
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "struct thermal_cooling_device *" __cpufreq_cooling_register
.BI "(struct device_node *np "  ","
.BI "struct cpufreq_policy *policy "  ","
.BI "struct em_perf_domain *em "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "np" 12
a valid struct device_node to the cooling device device tree node
.IP "policy" 12
cpufreq policy
Normally this should be same as cpufreq policy->related_cpus.
.IP "em" 12
Energy Model of the cpufreq policy
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This interface function registers the cpufreq cooling device with the name
"thermal-cpufreq-x". This api can support multiple instances of cpufreq
cooling devices. It also gives the opportunity to link the cooling device
with a device tree node, in order to bind it via the thermal DT code.
.SH "RETURN"
a valid struct thermal_cooling_device pointer on success,
on failure, it returns a corresponding \fBERR_PTR\fP.
