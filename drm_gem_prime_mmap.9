.SH NAME
drm_gem_prime_mmap \- PRIME mmap function for GEM drivers
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" drm_gem_prime_mmap
.BI "(struct drm_gem_object *obj "  ","
.BI "struct vm_area_struct *vma "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "obj" 12
GEM object
.IP "vma" 12
Virtual address range
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function sets up a userspace mapping for PRIME exported buffers using
the same codepath that is used for regular GEM buffer mapping on the DRM fd.
The fake GEM offset is added to vma->vm_pgoff and \fIdrm_driver->fops\fP->mmap is
called to set up the mapping.

Drivers can use this as their \fIdrm_driver.gem_prime_mmap\fP callback.
