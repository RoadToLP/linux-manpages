.SH NAME
skb_partial_csum_set \- set up and verify partial csum values for packet
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "bool" skb_partial_csum_set
.BI "(struct sk_buff *skb "  ","
.BI "u16 start "  ","
.BI "u16 off "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "skb" 12
the skb to set
.IP "start" 12
the number of bytes after skb->data to start checksumming.
.IP "off" 12
the offset from start to place the checksum.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
For untrusted partially-checksummed packets, we need to make sure the values
for skb->csum_start and skb->csum_offset are valid so we don't oops.

This function checks and sets those values and skb->ip_summed: if this
returns false you should drop the packet.
