.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "drive" 12
The drive to unmap

Teardown mappings after DMA has completed. This must be called
after the completion of each use of ide_build_dmatable and before
the next use of ide_build_dmatable. Failure to do so will cause
an oops as only one mapping can be live for each target at a given
time.
