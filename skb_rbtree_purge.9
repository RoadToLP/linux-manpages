Return value: the sum of truesizes of all purged skbs.

Delete all buffers on an \fIsk_buff\fP rbtree. Each buffer is removed from
the list and one reference dropped. This function does not take
any lock. Synchronization should be handled by the caller (e.g., TCP
out-of-order queue is protected by the socket lock).
