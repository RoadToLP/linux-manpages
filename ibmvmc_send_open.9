.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This command is sent by the management partition as the result of a
management partition device request. It causes the hypervisor to
prepare a set of data buffers for the management application connection
indicated HMC idx. A unique HMC Idx would be used if multiple management
applications running concurrently were desired. Before responding to this
command, the hypervisor must provide the management partition with at
least one of these new buffers via the Add Buffer. This indicates whether
the messages are inbound or outbound from the hypervisor.
.SH "RETURN"
