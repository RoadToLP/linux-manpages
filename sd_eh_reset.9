sd-issued command that has failed

This function is called by the SCSI midlayer before starting
SCSI EH. When counting medium access failures we have to be
careful to register it only only once per device and SCSI EH run;
there might be several timed out commands which will cause the
'max_medium_access_timeouts' counter to trigger after the first
SCSI EH run already and set the device to offline.
So this function resets the internal counter before starting SCSI EH.
