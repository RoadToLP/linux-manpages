atomic state
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This is the dpll version of \fBdrm_atomic_helper_swap_state\fP since the
helper does not handle driver-specific global state.

For consistency with atomic helpers this function does a complete swap,
i.e. it also puts the current state into \fIstate\fP, even though there is no
need for that at this moment.
