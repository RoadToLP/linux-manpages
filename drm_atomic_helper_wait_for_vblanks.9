.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Helper to, after atomic commit, wait for vblanks on all affected
CRTCs (ie. before cleaning up old framebuffers using
\fBdrm_atomic_helper_cleanup_planes\fP). It will only wait on CRTCs where the
framebuffers have actually changed to optimize for the legacy cursor and
plane update use-case.

Drivers using the nonblocking commit tracking support initialized by calling
\fBdrm_atomic_helper_setup_commit\fP should look at
\fBdrm_atomic_helper_wait_for_flip_done\fP as an alternative.
