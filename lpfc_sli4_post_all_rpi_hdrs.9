.SH SYNOPSIS

pointer to lpfc hba data structure.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This routine is invoked to post rpi header templates to the
HBA consistent with the SLI-4 interface spec.  This routine
posts a SLI4_PAGE_SIZE memory region to the port to hold up to
SLI4_PAGE_SIZE modulo 64 rpi context headers.

This routine does not require any locks.  It's usage is expected
to be driver load or reset recovery when the driver is
sequential.

Return codes
0 - successful
-EIO - The mailbox failed to complete successfully.
When this error occurs, the driver is not guaranteed
to have any rpi regions posted to the device and
must either attempt to repost the regions or take a
fatal error.
