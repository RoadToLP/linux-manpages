.SH NAME
del_gendisk \- remove the gendisk
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" del_gendisk
.BI "(struct gendisk *disk "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "disk" 12
the struct gendisk to remove
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Removes the gendisk and all its associated resources. This deletes the
partitions associated with the gendisk, and unregisters the associated
request_queue.

This is the counter to the respective \fB__device_add_disk\fP call.

The final removal of the struct gendisk happens when its refcount reaches 0
with \fBput_disk\fP, which should be called after \fBdel_gendisk\fP, if
\fB__device_add_disk\fP was used.

Drivers exist which depend on the release of the gendisk to be synchronous,
it should not be deferred.
.SH "CONTEXT"
can sleep
