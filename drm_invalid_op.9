DRM device for the ioctl
.IP "data" 12
data pointer for the ioctl

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This no-op implementation for drm ioctls is useful for deprecated
functionality where we really don't want to allow userspace to call the ioctl
any more. This is the case for old ums interfaces for drivers that
transitioned to kms gradually and so kept the old legacy tables around. This
only applies to radeon and i915 kms drivers, other drivers shouldn't need to
use this function.

Always fails with a return value of -EINVAL.
