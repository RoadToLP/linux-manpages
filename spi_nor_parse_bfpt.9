.SH NAME
spi_nor_parse_bfpt \- read and parse the Basic Flash Parameter Table.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" spi_nor_parse_bfpt
.BI "(struct spi_nor *nor "  ","
.BI "const struct sfdp_parameter_header *bfpt_header "  ","
.BI "struct spi_nor_flash_parameter *params "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "nor" 12
pointer to a 'struct spi_nor'
.IP "bfpt_header" 12
pointer to the 'struct sfdp_parameter_header' describing
the Basic Flash Parameter Table length and version
.IP "params" 12
pointer to the 'struct spi_nor_flash_parameter' to be
filled
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The Basic Flash Parameter Table is the main and only mandatory table as
defined by the SFDP (JESD216) specification.
It provides us with the total size (memory density) of the data array and
the number of address bytes for Fast Read, Page Program and Sector Erase
commands.
For Fast READ commands, it also gives the number of mode clock cycles and
wait states (regrouped in the number of dummy clock cycles) for each
supported instruction op code.
For Page Program, the page size is now available since JESD216 rev A, however
the supported instruction op codes are still not provided.
For Sector Erase commands, this table stores the supported instruction op
codes and the associated sector sizes.
Finally, the Quad Enable Requirements (QER) are also available since JESD216
rev A. The QER bits encode the manufacturer dependent procedure to be
executed to set the Quad Enable (QE) bit in some internal register of the
Quad SPI memory. Indeed the QE bit, when it exists, must be set before
sending any Quad SPI command to the memory. Actually, setting the QE bit
tells the memory to reassign its WP# and HOLD#/RESET# pins to functions IO2
and IO3 hence enabling 4 (Quad) I/O lines.
.SH "RETURN"
0 on success, -errno otherwise.
