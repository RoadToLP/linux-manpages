.SH "DESCRIPTION"

This function is called when a super_block is about to be destroyed and
flushes in-flight inode wb switches.  An inode wb switch goes through
RCU and then workqueue, so the two need to be flushed in order to ensure
that all previously scheduled switches are finished.  As wb switches are
rare occurrences and \fBsynchronize_rcu\fP can take a while, perform
flushing iff wb switches are in flight.
