.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Adds a link to device which is upper to this one. In this case, only
one master upper device can be linked, although other non-master devices
might be linked as well. The caller must hold the RTNL lock.
On a failure a negative errno code is returned. On success the reference
counts are adjusted and the function returns zero.
