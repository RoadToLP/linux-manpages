.SH NAME
usb_autopm_get_interface \- increment a USB interface's PM-usage counter
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" usb_autopm_get_interface
.BI "(struct usb_interface *intf "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "intf" 12
the usb_interface whose counter should be incremented
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This routine should be called by an interface driver when it wants to
use \fIintf\fP and needs to guarantee that it is not suspended.  In addition,
the routine prevents \fIintf\fP from being autosuspended subsequently.  (Note
that this will not prevent suspend events originating in the PM core.)
This prevention will persist until \fBusb_autopm_put_interface\fP is called
or \fIintf\fP is unbound.  A typical example would be a character-device
driver when its device file is opened.

\fIintf\fP's usage counter is incremented to prevent subsequent autosuspends.
However if the autoresume fails then the counter is re-decremented.

This routine can run only in process context.
.SH "RETURN"
0 on success.
