.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Walks the subtree of clks starting with clk and recalculates rates as it
goes.  Note that if a clk does not implement the .recalc_rate callback then
it is assumed that the clock will take on the rate of its parent.

clk_recalc_rates also propagates the POST_RATE_CHANGE notification,
if necessary.
