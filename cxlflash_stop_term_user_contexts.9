.SH NAME
cxlflash_stop_term_user_contexts \- stops/terminates known user contexts
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" cxlflash_stop_term_user_contexts
.BI "(struct cxlflash_cfg *cfg "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "cfg" 12
Internal structure associated with the host.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
When the host needs to go down, all users must be quiesced and their
memory freed. This is accomplished by putting the contexts in error
state which will notify the user and let them 'drive' the tear down.
Meanwhile, this routine camps until all user contexts have been removed.

Note that the main loop in this routine will always execute at least once
to flush the reset_waitq.
