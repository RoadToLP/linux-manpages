lpfc_pci_suspend_one_s3 \- PCI func to suspend SLI-3 device for power mgmnt
.SH SYNOPSIS

.BI "(struct device *dev_d "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dev_d" 12
pointer to device
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This routine is to be called from the kernel's PCI subsystem to support
system Power Management (PM) to device with SLI-3 interface spec. When
PM invokes this method, it quiesces the device by stopping the driver's
worker thread for the device, turning off device's interrupt and DMA,
and bring the device offline. Note that as the driver implements the
minimum PM requirements to a power-aware driver's PM support for the
suspend/resume -- all the possible PM messages (SUSPEND, HIBERNATE, FREEZE)
to the \fBsuspend\fP method call will be treated as SUSPEND and the driver will
fully reinitialize its device during \fBresume\fP method call, the driver will
set device to PCI_D3hot state in PCI config space instead of setting it
according to the \fImsg\fP provided by the PM.

Return code
0 - driver suspended the device
Error otherwise
