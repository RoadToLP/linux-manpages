lpfc_els_rcv_rscn \- Process an unsolicited rscn iocb
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" lpfc_els_rcv_rscn
.BI "(struct lpfc_vport *vport "  ","
.BI "struct lpfc_iocbq *cmdiocb "  ","
.BI "struct lpfc_nodelist *ndlp "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "vport" 12
pointer to a host virtual N_Port data structure.
.IP "cmdiocb" 12
pointer to lpfc command iocb data structure.
.IP "ndlp" 12
pointer to a node-list data structure.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This routine processes an unsolicited RSCN (Registration State Change
Notification) IOCB. First, the payload of the unsolicited RSCN is walked
to invoke \fBfc_host_post_event\fP routine to the FC transport layer. If the
discover state machine is about to begin discovery, it just accepts the
RSCN and the discovery process will satisfy the RSCN. If this RSCN only
contains N_Port IDs for other vports on this HBA, it just accepts the
RSCN and ignore processing it. If the state machine is in the recovery
state, the fc_rscn_id_list of this \fIvport\fP is walked and the
\fBlpfc_rscn_recovery_check\fP routine is invoked to send recovery event for
all nodes that match RSCN payload. Otherwise, the \fBlpfc_els_handle_rscn\fP
routine is invoked to handle the RSCN event.

Return code
0 - Just sent the acc response
1 - Sent the acc response and waited for name server completion
