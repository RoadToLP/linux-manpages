.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "vport" 12
pointer to a host virtual N_Port data structure.
.IP "flag" 12
the els command code to be accepted.
.IP "oldiocb" 12
pointer to the original lpfc command iocb data structure.
.IP "ndlp" 12
pointer to a node-list data structure.
.IP "mbox" 12
pointer to the driver internal queue element for mailbox command.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This routine prepares and issues an Accept (ACC) response IOCB
command. It uses the \fIflag\fP to properly set up the IOCB field for the
specific ACC response command to be issued and invokes the
\fBlpfc_sli_issue_iocb\fP routine to send out ACC response IOCB. If a
\fImbox\fP pointer is passed in, it will be put into the context_un.mbox
field of the IOCB for the completion callback function to issue the
mailbox command to the HBA later when callback is invoked.

Note that, in \fBlpfc_prep_els_iocb\fP routine, the reference count of ndlp
will be incremented by 1 for holding the ndlp and the reference to ndlp
will be stored into the context1 field of the IOCB for the completion
callback function to the corresponding response ELS IOCB command.

Return code
0 - Successfully issued acc response
1 - Failed to issue acc response
