.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "p" 12
object to reallocate memory for.
.IP "new_size" 12
how many bytes of memory are required.

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The contents of the object pointed to are preserved up to the
lesser of the new and old sizes (__GFP_ZERO flag is effectively ignored).
If \fIp\fP is NULL, \fBkrealloc\fP behaves exactly like \fBkmalloc\fP.  If \fInew_size\fP
is 0 and \fIp\fP is not a NULL pointer, the object pointed to is freed.
