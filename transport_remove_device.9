.SH NAME
transport_remove_device \- remove the visibility of a device
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" transport_remove_device
.BI "(struct device *dev "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dev" 12
generic device to remove
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This call removes the visibility of the device (to the user from
sysfs), but does not destroy it.  To eliminate a device entirely
you must also call transport_destroy_device.  If you don't need to
do remove and destroy as separate operations, use
\fBtransport_unregister_device\fP (see transport_class.h) which will
perform both calls for you.
