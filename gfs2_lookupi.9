gfs2_lookupi \- Look up a filename in a directory and return its inode
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "struct inode *" gfs2_lookupi
.BI "(struct inode *dir "  ","
.BI "const struct qstr *name "  ","
.BI "int is_root "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dir" 12
-- undescribed --
.IP "name" 12
The name of the inode to look for
.IP "is_root" 12
If 1, ignore the caller's permissions
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This can be called via the VFS filldir function when NFS is doing
a readdirplus and the inode which its intending to stat isn't
already in cache. In this case we must not take the directory glock
again, since the readdir call will have already taken that lock.
.SH "RETURN"
errno
