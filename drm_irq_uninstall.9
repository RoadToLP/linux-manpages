.SH NAME
drm_irq_uninstall \- uninstall the IRQ handler
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" drm_irq_uninstall
.BI "(struct drm_device *dev "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dev" 12
DRM device
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Calls the driver's \fIdrm_driver.irq_uninstall\fP function and unregisters the IRQ
handler.  This should only be called by drivers which used \fBdrm_irq_install\fP
to set up their interrupt handler. Other drivers must only reset
\fIdrm_device.irq_enabled\fP to false.

Note that for kernel modesetting drivers it is a bug if this function fails.
The sanity checks are only to catch buggy user modesetting drivers which call
the same function through an ioctl.
.SH "RETURN"
Zero on success or a negative error code on failure.
