.SH NAME
gpiochip_is_requested \- return string iff signal was requested
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "const char *" gpiochip_is_requested
.BI "(struct gpio_chip *gc "  ","
.BI "unsigned int offset "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gc" 12
controller managing the signal
.IP "offset" 12
of signal within controller's 0..(ngpio - 1) range
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Returns NULL if the GPIO is not currently requested, else a string.
The string returned is the label passed to \fBgpio_request\fP; if none has been
passed it is a meaningless, non-NULL constant.

This function is for use by GPIO controller drivers.  The label can
help with diagnostics, and knowing that the signal is used as a GPIO
can help avoid accidentally multiplexing it to another controller.
