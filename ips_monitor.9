.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This is the main function for the IPS driver.  It monitors power and
tempurature in the MCP and adjusts CPU and GPU power clams accordingly.

We keep a 5s moving average of power consumption and tempurature.  Using
that data, along with CPU vs GPU preference, we adjust the power clamps
up or down.
