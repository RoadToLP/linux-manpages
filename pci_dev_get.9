.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "struct pci_dev *" pci_dev_get

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Each live reference to a device should be refcounted.

Drivers for PCI devices should normally record such references in
their \fBprobe\fP methods, when they bind to a device, and release
them by calling \fBpci_dev_put\fP, in their \fBdisconnect\fP methods.

A pointer to the device with the incremented reference counter is returned.
