to download the firmware is performed before the release.

Firmware format
===============
spider_fw.bin is expected to be a file containing 6*1024*4 bytes, 4k being
the program for each sequencer. Use the command
tail -q -n +2 Seq_code1_0x088.txt Seq_code2_0x090.txt               *         Seq_code3_0x098.txt Seq_code4_0x0A0.txt Seq_code5_0x0A8.txt    *         Seq_code6_0x0B0.txt | xxd -r -p -c4 > spider_fw.bin

to generate spider_fw.bin, if you have sequencer programs with something
like the following contents for each sequencer:
<ONE LINE COMMENT>
<FIRST 4-BYTES-WORD FOR SEQUENCER>
<SECOND 4-BYTES-WORD FOR SEQUENCER>
\&...
<1024th 4-BYTES-WORD FOR SEQUENCER>
