.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function is supposed to be used only by a HD-audio controller
driver that needs the interaction with graphics driver.

This function initializes and sets up the audio component to communicate
with graphics driver.

Unlike \fBsnd_hdac_i915_init\fP, this function doesn't synchronize with the
binding with the DRM component.  Each caller needs to sync via master_bind
audio_ops.

Returns zero for success or a negative error code.
