.SH NAME
srp_tmo_valid \- check timeout combination validity
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" srp_tmo_valid
.BI "(int reconnect_delay "  ","
.BI "int fast_io_fail_tmo "  ","
.BI "long dev_loss_tmo "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "reconnect_delay" 12
Reconnect delay in seconds.
.IP "fast_io_fail_tmo" 12
Fast I/O fail timeout in seconds.
.IP "dev_loss_tmo" 12
Device loss timeout in seconds.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The combination of the timeout parameters must be such that SCSI commands
are finished in a reasonable time. Hence do not allow the fast I/O fail
timeout to exceed SCSI_DEVICE_BLOCK_MAX_TIMEOUT nor allow dev_loss_tmo to
exceed that limit if failing I/O fast has been disabled. Furthermore, these
parameters must be such that multipath can detect failed paths timely.
Hence do not allow all three parameters to be disabled simultaneously.
