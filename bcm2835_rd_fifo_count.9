bytes to read from RX FIFO
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The caller must ensure that \fIbs->rx_len\fP is greater than or equal to \fIcount\fP,
that the RX FIFO contains at least \fIcount\fP bytes and that the DMA Enable flag
in the CS register is set (such that a read from the FIFO register receives
32-bit instead of just 8-bit).  Moreover \fIbs->rx_buf\fP must not be NULL.
