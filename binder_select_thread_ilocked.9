.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Note that calling this function moves the thread off the waiting_threads
list, so it can only be woken up by the caller of this function, or a
signal. Therefore, callers *should* always wake up the thread this function
returns.
.SH "RETURN"
If there's a thread currently waiting for process work,
returns that thread. Otherwise returns NULL.
