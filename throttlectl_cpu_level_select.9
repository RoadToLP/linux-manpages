.SH NAME
throttlectl_cpu_level_select \- program CPU pulse skipper config
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" throttlectl_cpu_level_select
.BI "(struct tegra_soctherm *ts "  ","
.BI "enum soctherm_throttle_id throt "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "ts" 12
pointer to a struct tegra_soctherm
.IP "throt" 12
the LIGHT/HEAVY of throttle event id
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Pulse skippers are used to throttle clock frequencies.  This
function programs the pulse skippers based on \fIthrot\fP and platform
data.  This function is used on SoCs which have CPU-local pulse
skipper control, such as T13x. It programs soctherm's interface to
Denver:CCROC NV_THERM in terms of Low, Medium and HIGH throttling
vectors. PSKIP_BYPASS mode is set as required per HW spec.
