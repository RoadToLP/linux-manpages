.SH NAME
tty_register_device_attr \- register a tty device
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "struct device *" tty_register_device_attr
.BI "(struct tty_driver *driver "  ","
.BI "unsigned index "  ","
.BI "struct device *device "  ","
.BI "void *drvdata "  ","
.BI "const struct attribute_group **attr_grp "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "driver" 12
the tty driver that describes the tty device
.IP "index" 12
the index in the tty driver for this tty device
.IP "device" 12
a struct device that is associated with this tty device.
This field is optional, if there is no known struct device
for this tty device it can be set to NULL safely.
.IP "drvdata" 12
Driver data to be set to device.
.IP "attr_grp" 12
Attribute group to be set on device.

Returns a pointer to the struct device for this tty device
(or ERR_PTR(-EFOO) on error).

This call is required to be made to register an individual tty device
if the tty driver's flags have the TTY_DRIVER_DYNAMIC_DEV bit set.  If
that bit is not set, this function should not be called by a tty
driver.
