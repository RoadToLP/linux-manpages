.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Check FSM watchdog bark status and clear if needed.
Check all sensors to find ones that violated their critical threshold limits.
Clear and then re-enable the interrupt.

The level-triggered interrupt might deassert if the temperature returned to
within the threshold limits by the time the handler got scheduled. We
consider the irq to have been handled in that case.
