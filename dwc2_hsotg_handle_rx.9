.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The IRQ handler has detected that the RX FIFO has some data in it
that requires processing, so find out what is in there and do the
appropriate read.

The RXFIFO is a true FIFO, the packets coming out are still in packet
chunks, so if you have x packets received on an endpoint you'll get x
FIFO events delivered, each with a packet's worth of data in it.

When using DMA, we should not be processing events from the RXFIFO
as the actual data should be sent to the memory directly and we turn
on the completion interrupts to get notifications of transfer completion.
