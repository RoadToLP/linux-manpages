.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This routine is a task that is schedule by the interrupt handler
to perform the background processing for interrupts.  We put it
on a task queue that is consumed whenever the scheduler runs; that's
so you can do anything (i.e. put the process to sleep etc).  In fact,
the mid-level tries to sleep when it reaches the driver threshold
"host->can_queue". This can cause a panic if we were in our interrupt code.
