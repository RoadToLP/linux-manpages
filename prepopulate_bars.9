.SH NAME
prepopulate_bars \- Fill in BARs with defaults
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" prepopulate_bars
.BI "(struct hv_pcibus_device *hbus "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "hbus" 12
Root PCI bus, as understood by this driver
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The core PCI driver code seems much, much happier if the BARs
for a device have values upon first scan. So fill them in.
The algorithm below works down from large sizes to small,
attempting to pack the assignments optimally. The assumption,
enforced in other parts of the code, is that the beginning of
the memory-mapped I/O space will be aligned on the largest
BAR size.
