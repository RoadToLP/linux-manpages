.SH NAME
blk_crypto_start_using_key \- Start using a blk_crypto_key on a device
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" blk_crypto_start_using_key
.BI "(const struct blk_crypto_key *key "  ","
.BI "struct request_queue *q "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "key" 12
A key to use on the device
.IP "q" 12
the request queue for the device
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Upper layers must call this function to ensure that either the hardware
supports the key's crypto settings, or the crypto API fallback has transforms
for the needed mode allocated and ready to go. This function may allocate
an skcipher, and *should not* be called from the data path, since that might
cause a deadlock
.SH "RETURN"
0 on success; -ENOPKG if the hardware doesn't support the key and
blk-crypto-fallback is either disabled or the needed algorithm
is disabled in the crypto API; or another -errno code.
