.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Attach legacy IDE interfaces by scanning the usual IRQ/port suspects.
Right now we do not scan the ide0 and ide1 address but should do so
for non PCI systems or systems with no PCI IDE legacy mode devices.
If you fix that note there are special cases to consider like VLB
drivers and CS5510/20.
