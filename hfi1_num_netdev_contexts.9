.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dd" 12
device on which to allocate netdev contexts
.IP "available_contexts" 12
count of available receive contexts
.IP "cpu_mask" 12
mask of possible cpus to include for contexts
.SH "RETURN"
count of physical cores on a node or the remaining available recv
contexts for netdev recv context usage up to the maximum of
HFI1_MAX_NETDEV_CTXTS.
A value of 0 can be returned when acceleration is explicitly turned off,
a memory allocation error occurs or when there are no available contexts.
