.SH NAME
omap3_set_i2c_timings \- sets i2c sleep timings for a channel
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" omap3_set_i2c_timings
.BI "(struct voltagedomain *voltdm "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "voltdm" 12
channel to configure
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Calculates and sets up voltage controller to use I2C based
voltage scaling for sleep modes. This can be used for either off mode
or retention. Off mode has additionally an option to use sys_off_mode
pad, which uses a global signal to program the whole power IC to
off-mode.

Note that pmic is not controlling the voltage scaling during
retention signaled over I2C4, so we can keep voltsetup2 as 0.
And the oscillator is not shut off over I2C4, so no need to
set clksetup.
