.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function returns the number of free blocks for an rgrp.
That's the clone-free blocks (blocks that are free, not including those
still being used for unlinked files that haven't been deleted.)

It also subtracts any blocks reserved by someone else, but does not
include free blocks that are still part of our current reservation,
because obviously we can (and will) allocate them.
