.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Wait for packet egress, optionally pause for credit return

Egress halt and Context halt are not necessarily the same thing, so
check for both.
.SH "NOTE"
The context halt bit may not be set immediately.  Because of this,
it is necessary to check the SW SFC_HALTED bit (set in the IRQ) and the HW
context bit to determine if the context is halted.
