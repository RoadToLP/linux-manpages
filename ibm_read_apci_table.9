.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "filp" 12
the open sysfs file
.IP "kobj" 12
the kobject this binary attribute is a part of
.IP "bin_attr" 12
struct bin_attribute for this file
.IP "buffer" 12
the kernel space buffer to fill
.IP "pos" 12
the offset into the file
.IP "size" 12

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Gets registered with sysfs as the reader callback
to be executed when /sys/bus/pci/slots/apci_table gets read.

Since we don't get notified on open and close for this file,
things get really tricky here...
our solution is to only allow reading the table in all at once.
