.SH NAME
disk_release \- releases all allocated resources of the gendisk
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" disk_release
.BI "(struct device *dev "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dev" 12
the device representing this disk
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function releases all allocated resources of the gendisk.

Drivers which used \fB__device_add_disk\fP have a gendisk with a request_queue
assigned. Since the request_queue sits on top of the gendisk for these
drivers we also call \fBblk_put_queue\fP for them, and we expect the
request_queue refcount to reach 0 at this point, and so the request_queue
will also be freed prior to the disk.
.SH "CONTEXT"
