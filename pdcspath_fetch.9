.SH NAME
pdcspath_fetch \- This function populates the path entry structs.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" pdcspath_fetch
.BI "(struct pdcspath_entry *entry "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "entry" 12
A pointer to an allocated pdcspath_entry.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The general idea is that you don't read from the Stable Storage every time
you access the files provided by the facilities. We store a copy of the
content of the stable storage WRT various paths in these structs. We read
these structs when reading the files, and we will write to these structs when
writing to the files, and only then write them back to the Stable Storage.

This function expects to be called with \fIentry->rw_lock\fP write-hold.
