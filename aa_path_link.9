.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Handle the permission test for a link & target pair.  Permission
is encoded as a pair where the link permission is determined
first, and if allowed, the target is tested.  The target test
is done from the point of the link match (not start of DFA)
making the target permission dependent on the link permission match.

The subset test if required forces that permissions granted
on link are a subset of the permission granted to target.
.SH "RETURN"
0 if allowed else error
