.SH NAME
binder_do_fd_close \- close list of file descriptors
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" binder_do_fd_close
.BI "(struct callback_head *twork "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "twork" 12
callback head for task work
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
It is not safe to call \fBksys_close\fP during the \fBbinder_ioctl\fP
function if there is a chance that binder's own file descriptor
might be closed. This is to meet the requirements for using
\fBfdget\fP (see comments for \fB__fget_light\fP). Therefore use
\fBtask_work_add\fP to schedule the close operation once we have
returned from \fBbinder_ioctl\fP. This function is a callback
for that mechanism and does the actual \fBksys_close\fP on the
given file descriptor.
