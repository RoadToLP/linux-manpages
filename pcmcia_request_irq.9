.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBpcmcia_request_irq\fP is a wrapper around \fBrequest_irq\fP which allows
the PCMCIA core to clean up the registration in \fBpcmcia_disable_device\fP.
Drivers are free to use \fBrequest_irq\fP directly, but then they need to
call \fBfree_irq\fP themselfves, too. Also, only IRQF_SHARED capable IRQ
handlers are allowed.
