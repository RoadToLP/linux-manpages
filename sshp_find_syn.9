.SH NAME
sshp_find_syn \- Find SSH SYN bytes in the given data span.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "bool" sshp_find_syn
.BI "(const struct ssam_span *src "  ","
.BI "struct ssam_span *rem "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "src" 12
The data span to search in.
.IP "rem" 12
The span (output) indicating the remaining data, starting with SSH
SYN bytes, if found.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Search for SSH SYN bytes in the given source span. If found, set the \fIrem\fP
span to the remaining data, starting with the first SYN bytes and capped by
the source span length, and return true. This function does not copy any
data, but rather only sets pointers to the respective start addresses and
length values.

If no SSH SYN bytes could be found, set the \fIrem\fP span to the zero-length
span at the end of the source span and return false.

If partial SSH SYN bytes could be found at the end of the source span, set
the \fIrem\fP span to cover these partial SYN bytes, capped by the end of the
source span, and return false. This function should then be re-run once
more data is available.
.SH "RETURN"
Returns true if a complete SSH SYN sequence could be found,
false otherwise.
