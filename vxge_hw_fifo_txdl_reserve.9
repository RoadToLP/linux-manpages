.SH NAME
vxge_hw_fifo_txdl_reserve \- Reserve fifo descriptor.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "enum vxge_hw_status" vxge_hw_fifo_txdl_reserve
.BI "(struct __vxge_hw_fifo *fifo "  ","
.BI "void **txdlh "  ","
.BI "void **txdl_priv "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "fifo" 12
Handle to the fifo object used for non offload send
.IP "txdlh" 12
Reserved descriptor. On success HW fills this "out" parameter
with a valid handle.
.IP "txdl_priv" 12
Buffer to return the pointer to per txdl space
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Reserve a single TxDL (that is, fifo descriptor)
for the subsequent filling-in by driver)
and posting on the corresponding channel (\fIchannelh\fP)
via \fBvxge_hw_fifo_txdl_post\fP.
.SH "NOTE"
it is the responsibility of driver to reserve multiple descriptors
for lengthy (e.g., LSO) transmit operation. A single fifo descriptor
carries up to configured number (fifo.max_frags) of contiguous buffers.
.SH "RETURN"
VXGE_HW_OK - success;
VXGE_HW_INF_OUT_OF_DESCRIPTORS - Currently no descriptors available
