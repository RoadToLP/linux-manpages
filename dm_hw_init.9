.SH NAME
dm_hw_init \- Initialize DC device
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" dm_hw_init
.BI "(void *handle "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "handle" 12
The base driver device containing the amdgpu_dm device.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Initialize the \fIstruct amdgpu_display_manager\fP device. This involves calling
the initializers of each DM component, then populating the struct with them.

Although the function implies hardware initialization, both hardware and
software are initialized here. Splitting them out to their relevant init
hooks is a future TODO item.

Some notable things that are initialized here:

- Display Core, both software and hardware
- DC modules that we need (freesync and color management)
- DRM software states
- Interrupt sources and handlers
- Vblank support
- Debug FS entries, if enabled
