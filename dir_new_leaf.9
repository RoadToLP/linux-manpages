.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This adds a new dir leaf onto an existing leaf when there is not
enough space to add a new dir entry. This is a last resort after
we've expanded the hash table to max size and also split existing
leaf blocks, so it will only occur for very large directories.

The dist parameter is set to 1 for leaf blocks directly attached
to the hash table, 2 for one layer of indirection, 3 for two layers
etc. We are thus able to tell the difference between an old leaf
with dist set to zero (i.e. "don't know") and a new one where we
set this information for debug/fsck purposes.
.SH "RETURN"
0 on success, or -ve on error
