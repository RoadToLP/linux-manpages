.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Notify the EC that the display has been turned back on and the driver has
exited its lower-power state. This notification is the counterpart to the
display-off notification sent via \fBssam_ctrl_notif_display_off\fP and will
reverse its effects, including resetting events to their default behavior.

This function will only send the display-on notification command if display
notifications are supported by the EC. Currently all known devices support
these notifications.

See \fBssam_ctrl_notif_display_off\fP for more details.
.SH "RETURN"
Returns zero on success or if no request has been executed, the
status of the executed SAM request if that request failed, or -EPROTO if
an unexpected response has been received.
