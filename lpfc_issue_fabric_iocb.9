.SH NAME
lpfc_issue_fabric_iocb \- Issue a fabric iocb command
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" lpfc_issue_fabric_iocb
.BI "(struct lpfc_hba *phba "  ","
.BI "struct lpfc_iocbq *iocb "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "phba" 12
pointer to lpfc hba data structure.
.IP "iocb" 12
pointer to lpfc command iocb data structure.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This routine is used as the top-level API for issuing a fabric iocb command
such as FLOGI and FDISC. To accommodate certain switch fabric, this driver
function makes sure that only one fabric bound iocb will be outstanding at
any given time. As such, this function will first check to see whether there
is already an outstanding fabric iocb on the wire. If so, it will put the
newly issued iocb onto the driver internal fabric iocb list, waiting to be
issued later. Otherwise, it will issue the iocb on the wire and update the
fabric iocb count it indicate that there is one fabric iocb on the wire.

Note, this implementation has a potential sending out fabric IOCBs out of
order. The problem is caused by the construction of the "ready" boolen does
not include the condition that the internal fabric IOCB list is empty. As
such, it is possible a fabric IOCB issued by this routine might be "jump"
ahead of the fabric IOCBs in the internal list.

Return code
IOCB_SUCCESS - either fabric iocb put on the list or issued successfully
IOCB_ERROR - failed to issue fabric iocb
