.SH NAME
xemaclite_send \- Transmit a frame
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "netdev_tx_t" xemaclite_send
.BI "(struct sk_buff *orig_skb "  ","
.BI "struct net_device *dev "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "orig_skb" 12
Pointer to the socket buffer to be transmitted
.IP "dev" 12
Pointer to the network device
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function checks if the Tx buffer of the Emaclite device is free to send
data. If so, it fills the Tx buffer with data from socket buffer data,
updates the stats and frees the socket buffer. The Tx completion is signaled
by an interrupt. If the Tx buffer isn't free, then the socket buffer is
deferred and the Tx queue is stopped so that the deferred socket buffer can
be transmitted when the Emaclite device is free to transmit data.
.SH "RETURN"
NETDEV_TX_OK, always.
