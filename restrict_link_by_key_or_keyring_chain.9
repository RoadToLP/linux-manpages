.BI "(struct key *dest_keyring "  ","
.BI "const struct key_type *type "  ","
.BI "const union key_payload *payload "  ","
.BI "struct key *trusted "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dest_keyring" 12
Keyring being linked to.
.IP "type" 12
The type of key being added.
.IP "payload" 12
The payload of the new key.
.IP "trusted" 12
A key or ring of keys that can be used to vouch for the new cert.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Check the new certificate against the key or keys passed in the data
parameter and against the keys already linked to the destination keyring. If
one of those is the signing key and validates the new certificate, then mark
the new certificate as being ok to link.

Returns 0 if the new certificate was accepted, -ENOKEY if we
couldn't find a matching parent certificate in the trusted list,
-EKEYREJECTED if the signature check fails, -ENOPKG if the signature uses
unsupported crypto, or some other error if there is a matching certificate
but the signature check cannot be performed.
