.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The primary method of mounting UBIFS is by specifying the UBI volume
character device node path. However, UBIFS may also be mounted withoug any
character device node using one of the following methods:

o ubiX_Y    - mount UBI device number X, volume Y;
o ubiY      - mount UBI device number 0, volume Y;
o ubiX:NAME - mount UBI device X, volume with name NAME;
o ubi:NAME  - mount UBI device 0, volume with name NAME.

Alternative '!' separator may be used instead of ':' (because some shells
like busybox may interpret ':' as an NFS host name separator). This function
returns UBI volume description object in case of success and a negative
error code in case of failure.
