.SH "DESCRIPTION"
After opening a port, all units configured on this port have to be
registered with the SCSI midlayer. This function should be called
after calling fc_remote_port_add, so that the fc_rport is already
ONLINE and the call to scsi_scan_target runs the same way as the
call in the FC transport class.
