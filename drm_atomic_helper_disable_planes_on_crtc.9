.SH NAME
drm_atomic_helper_disable_planes_on_crtc \- helper to disable CRTC's planes
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" drm_atomic_helper_disable_planes_on_crtc
.BI "(struct drm_crtc_state *old_crtc_state "  ","
.BI "bool atomic "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "old_crtc_state" 12
atomic state object with the old CRTC state
.IP "atomic" 12
if set, synchronize with CRTC's atomic_begin/flush hooks
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Disables all planes associated with the given CRTC. This can be
used for instance in the CRTC helper atomic_disable callback to disable
all planes.

If the atomic-parameter is set the function calls the CRTC's
atomic_begin hook before and atomic_flush hook after disabling the
planes.

It is a bug to call this function without having implemented the
\fIdrm_plane_helper_funcs.atomic_disable\fP plane hook.
