.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function provides a write implementation for the "width" interface
to the hardware latency detector. It can be used to configure
for how many us of the total window us we will actively sample for any
hardware-induced latency periods. Obviously, it is not possible to
sample constantly and have the system respond to a sample reader, or,
worse, without having the system appear to have gone out to lunch. It
is enforced that width is less that the total window size.
