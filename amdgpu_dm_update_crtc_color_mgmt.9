.SH NAME
amdgpu_dm_update_crtc_color_mgmt \- Maps DRM color management to DC stream.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" amdgpu_dm_update_crtc_color_mgmt
.BI "(struct dm_crtc_state *crtc "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "crtc" 12
amdgpu_dm crtc state
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
With no plane level color management properties we're free to use any
of the HW blocks as long as the CRTC CTM always comes before the
CRTC RGM and after the CRTC DGM.

The CRTC RGM block will be placed in the RGM LUT block if it is non-linear.
The CRTC DGM block will be placed in the DGM LUT block if it is non-linear.
The CRTC CTM will be placed in the gamut remap block if it is non-linear.

The RGM block is typically more fully featured and accurate across
all ASICs - DCE can't support a custom non-linear CRTC DGM.

For supporting both plane level color management and CRTC level color
management at once we have to either restrict the usage of CRTC properties
or blend adjustments together.

Returns 0 on success.
