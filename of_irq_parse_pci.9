.SH NAME
of_irq_parse_pci \- Resolve the interrupt for a PCI device
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" of_irq_parse_pci
.BI "(const struct pci_dev *pdev "  ","
.BI "struct of_phandle_args *out_irq "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "pdev" 12
the device whose interrupt is to be resolved
.IP "out_irq" 12
structure of_phandle_args filled by this function
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function resolves the PCI interrupt for a given PCI device. If a
device-node exists for a given pci_dev, it will use normal OF tree
walking. If not, it will implement standard swizzling and walk up the
PCI tree until an device-node is found, at which point it will finish
resolving using the OF tree walking.
