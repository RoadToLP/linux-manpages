.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Driver must call this function to properly de-allocate a previous enlisted
balloon pages before definitively releasing it back to the guest system.
This function tries to remove \fIn_req_pages\fP from the ballooned pages and
return them to the caller in the \fIpages\fP list.

Note that this function may fail to dequeue some pages even if the balloon
isn't empty - since the page list can be temporarily empty due to compaction
of isolated pages.
.SH "RETURN"
number of pages that were added to the \fIpages\fP list.
