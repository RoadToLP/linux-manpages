.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This is called to check if a mount point has any
open files, pwds, chroots or sub mounts. If the
mount has sub mounts this will return busy
regardless of whether the sub mounts are busy.

Doesn't take quota and stuff into account. IOW, in some cases it will
give false negatives. The main reason why it's here is that we need
a non-destructive way to look for easily umountable filesystems.
