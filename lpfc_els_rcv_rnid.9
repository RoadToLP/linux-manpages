This routine processes Request Node Identification Data (RNID) IOCB
received as an ELS unsolicited event. Only when the RNID specified format
0x0 or 0xDF (Topology Discovery Specific Node Identification Data)
present, this routine will invoke the \fBlpfc_els_rsp_rnid_acc\fP routine to
Accept (ACC) the RNID ELS command. All the other RNID formats are
rejected by invoking the \fBlpfc_els_rsp_reject\fP routine.

Return code
