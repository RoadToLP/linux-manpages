.IP "buffer" 12
the ring buffer to reserve from
.IP "length" 12
the length of the data to reserve (excluding event header)
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Returns a reserved event on the ring buffer to copy directly to.
The user of this interface will need to get the body to write into
and can use the \fBring_buffer_event_data\fP interface.

The length is the length of the data needed, not the event length
which also includes the event header.

Must be paired with ring_buffer_unlock_commit, unless NULL is returned.
If NULL is returned, then nothing has been allocated or locked.
