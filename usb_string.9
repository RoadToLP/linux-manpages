.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This converts the UTF-16LE encoded strings returned by devices, from
\fBusb_get_string_descriptor\fP, to null-terminated UTF-8 encoded ones
that are more usable in most kernel contexts.  Note that this function
chooses strings in the first language supported by the device.

This call is synchronous, and may not be used in an interrupt context.
.SH "RETURN"
length of the string (>= 0) or usb_control_msg status (< 0).
