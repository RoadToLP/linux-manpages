GenWQE device information
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Recovery notes:
As long as genwqe_thread runs we might access registers during
error data capture. Same is with the genwqe_health_thread.
When \fBgenwqe_bus_reset\fP fails this function might called two times:
first by the \fBgenwqe_health_thread\fP and later by \fBgenwqe_remove\fP to
unbind the device. We must be able to survive that.

This function must be robust enough to be called twice.
