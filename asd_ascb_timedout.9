.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" asd_ascb_timedout
.BI "(struct timer_list *t "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "t" 12
Timer context used to fetch the SCB
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This is the default timeout function which does the most necessary.
Upper layers can implement their own timeout function, say to free
resources they have with this SCB, and then call this one at the
end of their timeout function.  To do this, one should initialize
the ascb->timer.{function, expires} prior to calling the post
function. The timer is started by the post function.
