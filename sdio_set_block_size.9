.SH NAME
sdio_set_block_size \- set the block size of an SDIO function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" sdio_set_block_size
.BI "(struct sdio_func *func "  ","
.BI "unsigned blksz "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "func" 12
SDIO function to change
.IP "blksz" 12
new block size or 0 to use the default.

The default block size is the largest supported by both the function
and the host, with a maximum of 512 to ensure that arbitrarily sized
data transfer use the optimal (least) number of commands.

A driver may call this to override the default block size set by the
core. This can be used to set a block size greater than the maximum
that reported by the card; it is the driver's responsibility to ensure
it uses a value that the card supports.

Returns 0 on success, -EINVAL if the host does not support the
requested block size, or -EIO (etc.) if one of the resultant FBR block
size register writes failed.
