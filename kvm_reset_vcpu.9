.SH NAME
kvm_reset_vcpu \- sets core registers and sys_regs to reset value
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" kvm_reset_vcpu
.BI "(struct kvm_vcpu *vcpu "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "vcpu" 12
The VCPU pointer
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function finds the right table above and sets the registers on
the virtual CPU struct to their architecturally defined reset
values, except for registers whose reset is deferred until
\fBkvm_arm_vcpu_finalize\fP.
.SH "NOTE"
This function can be called from two paths: The KVM_ARM_VCPU_INIT
ioctl or as part of handling a request issued by another VCPU in the PSCI
handling code.  In the first case, the VCPU will not be loaded, and in the
second case the VCPU will be loaded.  Because this function operates purely
on the memory-backed values of system registers, we want to do a full put if
we were loaded (handling a request) and load the values back at the end of
the function.  Otherwise we leave the state alone.  In both cases, we
disable preemption around the vcpu reset as we would otherwise race with
preempt notifiers which also call put/load.
