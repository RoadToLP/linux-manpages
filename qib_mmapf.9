.SH "DESCRIPTION"
We use this to have a shared buffer between the kernel and the user code
for the rcvhdr queue, egr buffers, and the per-context user regs and pio
buffers in the chip.  We have the open and close entries so we can bump
the ref count and keep the driver from being unloaded while still mapped.
