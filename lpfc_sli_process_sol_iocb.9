Pointer to driver SLI ring object.
.IP "saveq" 12
Pointer to the response iocb to be processed.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function is called by the ring event handler for non-fcp
rings when there is a new response iocb in the response ring.
The caller is not required to hold any locks. This function
gets the command iocb associated with the response iocb and
calls the completion handler for the command iocb. If there
is no completion handler, the function will free the resources
associated with command iocb. If the response iocb is for
an already aborted command iocb, the status of the completion
is changed to IOSTAT_LOCAL_REJECT/IOERR_SLI_ABORTED.
This function always returns 1.
