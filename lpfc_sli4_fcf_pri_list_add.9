.SH NAME
lpfc_sli4_fcf_pri_list_add \- 
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" lpfc_sli4_fcf_pri_list_add
.BI "(struct lpfc_hba *phba "  ","
.BI "uint16_t fcf_index "  ","
.BI "struct fcf_record *new_fcf_record "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "phba" 12
pointer to lpfc hba data structure.
.IP "fcf_index" 12
the index of the fcf record to add
.IP "new_fcf_record" 12
pointer to a new FCF record.
This routine checks the priority of the fcf_index to be added.
If it is a lower priority than the current head of the fcf_pri list
then it is added to the list in the right order.
If it is the same priority as the current head of the list then it
is added to the head of the list and its bit in the rr_bmask is set.
If the fcf_index to be added is of a higher priority than the current
head of the list then the rr_bmask is cleared, its bit is set in the
rr_bmask and it is added to the head of the list.

0=success 1=failure
