.IP "vers" 12

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Returns zero if the registration request was dispatched successfully
and the rpcbind daemon returned success.  Otherwise, returns an errno
value that reflects the nature of the error (request could not be
dispatched, timed out, or rpcbind returned an error).

RPC services invoke this function to advertise their contact
information via the system's rpcbind daemon.  RPC services
invoke this function once for each [program, version, transport]
tuple they wish to advertise.

Callers may also unregister RPC services that are no longer
available by setting the passed-in port to zero.  This removes
all registered transports for [program, version] from the local
rpcbind database.

This function uses rpcbind protocol version 2 to contact the
local rpcbind daemon.

Registration works over both AF_INET and AF_INET6, and services
registered via this function are advertised as available for any
address.  If the local rpcbind daemon is listening on AF_INET6,
services registered via this function will be advertised on
IN6ADDR_ANY (ie available for all AF_INET and AF_INET6
addresses).
