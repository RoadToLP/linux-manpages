DFLL instance
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
If the DFLL is enabled, return the last rate reported by the DFLL's
internal monitoring hardware. This works in both open-loop and
closed-loop mode, and takes the output scaler setting into account.
Assumes that the monitor was programmed to monitor frequency before
the sample period started. If the driver believes that the DFLL is
currently uninitialized or disabled, it will return 0, since
otherwise the DFLL monitor data register will return the last
measured rate from when the DFLL was active.
