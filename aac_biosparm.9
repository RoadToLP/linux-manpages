Return the Heads/Sectors/Cylinders BIOS Disk Parameters for Disk.
The default disk geometry is 64 heads, 32 sectors, and the appropriate
number of cylinders so as not to exceed drive capacity.  In order for
disks equal to or larger than 1 GB to be addressable by the BIOS
without exceeding the BIOS limitation of 1024 cylinders, Extended
Translation should be enabled.   With Extended Translation enabled,
drives between 1 GB inclusive and 2 GB exclusive are given a disk
geometry of 128 heads and 32 sectors, and drives above 2 GB inclusive
are given a disk geometry of 255 heads and 63 sectors.  However, if
the BIOS detects that the Extended Translation setting does not match
the geometry in the partition table, then the translation inferred
from the partition table will be used by the BIOS, and a warning may
be displayed.
