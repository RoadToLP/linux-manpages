.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The INIT_VPI mailbox command supports virtual N_Ports. The driver uses the
command to activate a virtual N_Port. The HBA assigns a MAC address to use
with the virtual N Port.  The SLI Host issues this command before issuing a
FDISC to connect to the Fabric. The SLI Host should issue a REG_VPI after a
successful virtual NPort login.
