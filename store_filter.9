.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This routine is for changing a scancode filter value or mask.
It is triggered by writing to /sys/class/rc/rc?/[wakeup_]filter[_mask].
Returns -EINVAL if an invalid filter value for the current protocol was
specified or if scancode filtering is not supported by the driver, otherwise
returns \fIlen\fP.

Bits of the filter value corresponding to set bits in the filter mask are
compared against input scancodes and non-matching scancodes are discarded.

dev->lock is taken to guard against races between
store_filter and show_filter.
