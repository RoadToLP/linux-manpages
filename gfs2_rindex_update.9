.SH "DESCRIPTION"
We grab a lock on the rindex inode to make sure that it doesn't
change whilst we are performing an operation. We keep this lock
for quite long periods of time compared to other locks. This
doesn't matter, since it is shared and it is very, very rarely
accessed in the exclusive mode (i.e. only when expanding the filesystem).

This makes sure that we're using the latest copy of the resource index
special file, which might have been updated if someone expanded the
filesystem (via gfs2_grow utility), which adds new resource groups.
.SH "RETURN"
0 on succeess, error code otherwise
