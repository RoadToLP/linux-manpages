.SH NAME
_find_mpu_rt_port \- return omap_hwmod_ocp_if accessible by the MPU
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "struct omap_hwmod_ocp_if *" _find_mpu_rt_port
.BI "(struct omap_hwmod *oh "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "oh" 12
struct omap_hwmod *
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Given a pointer to a struct omap_hwmod record \fIoh\fP, return a pointer
to the struct omap_hwmod_ocp_if record that is used by the MPU to
communicate with the IP block.  This interface need not be directly
connected to the MPU (and almost certainly is not), but is directly
connected to the IP block represented by \fIoh\fP.  Returns a pointer
to the struct omap_hwmod_ocp_if * upon success, or returns NULL upon
error or if there does not appear to be a path from the MPU to this
IP block.
