lpfc_modify_hba_eq_delay \- Modify Delay Multiplier on EQs
.SH SYNOPSIS

.BI "(struct lpfc_hba *phba "  ","
.BI "uint32_t startq "  ","
.BI "uint32_t numq "  ","

.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "phba" 12
HBA structure that EQs are on.
.IP "startq" 12
The starting EQ index to modify
.IP "numq" 12
The number of EQs (consecutive indexes) to modify
.IP "usdelay" 12
amount of delay
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function revises the EQ delay on 1 or more EQs. The EQ delay
is set either by writing to a register (if supported by the SLI Port)
or by mailbox command. The mailbox command allows several EQs to be
updated at once.

The \fIphba\fP struct is used to send a mailbox command to HBA. The \fIstartq\fP
is used to get the starting EQ index to change. The \fInumq\fP value is
used to specify how many consecutive EQ indexes, starting at EQ index,
are to be changed. This function is asynchronous and will wait for any
mailbox commands to finish before returning.

On success this function will return a zero. If unable to allocate
enough memory this function will return -ENOMEM. If a mailbox command
fails this function will return -ENXIO. Note: on ENXIO, some EQs may
have had their delay multipler changed.
