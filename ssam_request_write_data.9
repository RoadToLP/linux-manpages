.SH NAME
ssam_request_write_data \- Construct and write SAM request message to buffer.
.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "buf" 12
The buffer to write the data to.
.IP "ctrl" 12
The controller via which the request will be sent.
.IP "spec" 12
The request data and specification.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Constructs a SAM/SSH request message and writes it to the provided buffer.
The request and transport counters, specifically RQID and SEQ, will be set
in this call. These counters are obtained from the controller. It is thus
only valid to send the resulting message via the controller specified here.

For calculation of the required buffer size, refer to the
\fBSSH_COMMAND_MESSAGE_LENGTH\fP macro.
.SH "RETURN"
Returns the number of bytes used in the buffer on success. Returns
-EINVAL if the payload length provided in the request specification is too
large (larger than SSH_COMMAND_MAX_PAYLOAD_SIZE) or if the provided buffer
is too small.
