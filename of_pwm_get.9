.SH NAME
of_pwm_get \- request a PWM via the PWM framework
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "struct pwm_device *" of_pwm_get
.BI "(struct device *dev "  ","
.BI "struct device_node *np "  ","
.BI "const char *con_id "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dev" 12
device for PWM consumer
.IP "np" 12
device node to get the PWM from
.IP "con_id" 12
consumer name
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Returns the PWM device parsed from the phandle and index specified in the
"pwms" property of a device tree node or a negative error-code on failure.
Values parsed from the device tree are stored in the returned PWM device
object.

If con_id is NULL, the first PWM device listed in the "pwms" property will
be requested. Otherwise the "pwm-names" property is used to do a reverse
lookup of the PWM index. This also means that the "pwm-names" property
becomes mandatory for devices that look up the PWM device via the con_id
parameter.
.SH "RETURN"
A pointer to the requested PWM device or an \fBERR_PTR\fP-encoded
error code on failure.
