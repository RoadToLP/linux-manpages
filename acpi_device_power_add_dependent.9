.SH NAME
acpi_device_power_add_dependent \- Add dependent device of this ACPI device
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" acpi_device_power_add_dependent
.BI "(struct acpi_device *adev "  ","
.BI "struct device *dev "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "adev" 12
ACPI device pointer
.IP "dev" 12
Dependent device
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
If \fIadev\fP has non-empty _PR0 the \fIdev\fP is added as dependent device to all
power resources returned by it. This means that whenever these power
resources are turned _ON the dependent devices get runtime resumed. This
is needed for devices such as PCI to allow its driver to re-initialize
it after it went to D0uninitialized.

If \fIadev\fP does not have _PR0 this does nothing.

Returns 0 in case of success and negative errno otherwise.
