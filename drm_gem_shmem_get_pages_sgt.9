.SH NAME
drm_gem_shmem_get_pages_sgt \- Pin pages, dma map them, and return a scatter/gather table for a shmem GEM object.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "struct sg_table *" drm_gem_shmem_get_pages_sgt
.BI "(struct drm_gem_object *obj "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "obj" 12
GEM object
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function returns a scatter/gather table suitable for driver usage. If
the sg table doesn't exist, the pages are pinned, dma-mapped, and a sg
table created.

This is the main function for drivers to get at backing storage, and it hides
and difference between dma-buf imported and natively allocated objects.
\fBdrm_gem_shmem_get_sg_table\fP should not be directly called by drivers.
.SH "RETURN"
A pointer to the scatter/gather table of pinned pages or errno on failure.
