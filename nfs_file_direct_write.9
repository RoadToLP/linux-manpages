.SH NAME
nfs_file_direct_write \- file direct write operation for NFS files
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "ssize_t" nfs_file_direct_write
.BI "(struct kiocb *iocb "  ","
.BI "struct iov_iter *iter "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "iocb" 12
target I/O control block
.IP "iter" 12
vector of user buffers from which to write data
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
We use this function for direct writes instead of calling
\fBgeneric_file_aio_write\fP in order to avoid taking the inode
semaphore and updating the i_size.  The NFS server will set
the new i_size and this client must read the updated size
back into its cache.  We let the server do generic write
parameter checking and report problems.

We eliminate local atime updates, see direct read above.

We avoid unnecessary page cache invalidations for normal cached
readers of this file.

Note that O_APPEND is not supported for NFS direct writes, as there
is no atomic O_APPEND write facility in the NFS protocol.
