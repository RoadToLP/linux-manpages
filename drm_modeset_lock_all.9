.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function takes all modeset locks, suitable where a more fine-grained
scheme isn't (yet) implemented. Locks must be dropped by calling the
\fBdrm_modeset_unlock_all\fP function.

This function is deprecated. It allocates a lock acquisition context and
stores it in \fIdrm_device.mode_config\fP. This facilitate conversion of
existing code because it removes the need to manually deal with the
acquisition context, but it is also brittle because the context is global
and care must be taken not to nest calls. New code should use the
\fBdrm_modeset_lock_all_ctx\fP function and pass in the context explicitly.
