.SH NAME
__scsi_device_lookup_by_target \- find a device given the target (UNLOCKED)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "struct scsi_device *" __scsi_device_lookup_by_target
.BI "(struct scsi_target *starget "  ","
.BI "u64 lun "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "starget" 12
SCSI target pointer
.IP "lun" 12
SCSI Logical Unit Number
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Looks up the scsi_device with the specified \fIlun\fP for a given
\fIstarget\fP.  The returned scsi_device does not have an additional
reference.  You must hold the host's host_lock over this call and
any access to the returned scsi_device. A scsi_device in state
SDEV_DEL is skipped.
.SH "NOTE"
The only reason why drivers should use this is because
they need to access the device list in irq context.  Otherwise you
really want to use scsi_device_lookup_by_target instead.
