.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" ixgbe_clean_rx_irq
.BI "(struct ixgbe_q_vector *q_vector "  ","
.BI "struct ixgbe_ring *rx_ring "  ","
.BI "const int budget "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "q_vector" 12
structure containing interrupt and ring information
.IP "rx_ring" 12
rx descriptor ring to transact packets on
.IP "budget" 12
Total limit on number of packets to process
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function provides a "bounce buffer" approach to Rx interrupt
processing.  The advantage to this is that on systems that have
expensive overhead for IOMMU access this provides a means of avoiding
it by maintaining the mapping of the page to the syste.
