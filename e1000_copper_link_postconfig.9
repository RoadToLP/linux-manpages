.BI "(struct e1000_hw *hw "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "hw" 12
Struct containing variables accessed by shared code
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Config the MAC and the PHY after link is up.
1) Set up the MAC to the current PHY speed/duplex
if we are on 82543.  If we
are on newer silicon, we only need to configure
collision distance in the Transmit Control Register.
2) Set up flow control on the MAC to that established with
the link partner.
3) Config DSP to improve Gigabit link quality for some PHY revisions.
