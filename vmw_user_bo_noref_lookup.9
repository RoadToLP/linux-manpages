.SH NAME
vmw_user_bo_noref_lookup \- Look up a vmw user buffer object without reference
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "struct vmw_buffer_object *" vmw_user_bo_noref_lookup
.BI "(struct ttm_object_file *tfile "  ","
.BI "u32 handle "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "tfile" 12
The TTM object file the handle is registered with.
.IP "handle" 12
The user buffer object handle.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function looks up a struct vmw_user_bo and returns a pointer to the
struct vmw_buffer_object it derives from without refcounting the pointer.
The returned pointer is only valid until \fBvmw_user_bo_noref_release\fP is
called, and the object pointed to by the returned pointer may be doomed.
Any persistent usage of the object requires a refcount to be taken using
\fBttm_bo_reference_unless_doomed\fP. Iff this function returns successfully it
needs to be paired with \fBvmw_user_bo_noref_release\fP and no sleeping-
or scheduling functions may be called inbetween these function calls.
.SH "RETURN"
A struct vmw_buffer_object pointer if successful or negative
error pointer on failure.
