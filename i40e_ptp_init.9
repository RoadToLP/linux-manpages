i40e_ptp_init \- Initialize the 1588 support after device probe or reset

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function sets device up for 1588 support. The first time it is run, it
will create a PHC clock device. It does not create a clock device if one
already exists. It also reconfigures the device after a reset.

The first time a clock is created, i40e_ptp_create_clock will set
pf->ptp_prev_hw_time to the current system time. During resets, it is
expected that this timespec will be set to the last known PTP clock time,
in order to preserve the clock time as close as possible across a reset.
