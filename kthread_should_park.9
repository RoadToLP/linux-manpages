.SH "DESCRIPTION"

When someone calls \fBkthread_park\fP on your kthread, it will be woken
and this will return true.  You should then do the necessary
cleanup and call \fBkthread_parkme\fP

Similar to \fBkthread_should_stop\fP, but this keeps the thread alive
and in a park position. \fBkthread_unpark\fP "restarts" the thread and
calls the thread function again.
