.SH NAME
intel_fbc_handle_fifo_underrun_irq \- disable FBC when we get a FIFO underrun
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" intel_fbc_handle_fifo_underrun_irq
.BI "(struct drm_i915_private *dev_priv "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dev_priv" 12
i915 device instance
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Without FBC, most underruns are harmless and don't really cause too many
problems, except for an annoying message on dmesg. With FBC, underruns can
become black screens or even worse, especially when paired with bad
watermarks. So in order for us to be on the safe side, completely disable FBC
in case we ever detect a FIFO underrun on any pipe. An underrun on any pipe
already suggests that watermarks may be bad, so try to be as safe as
possible.

This function is called from the IRQ handler.
