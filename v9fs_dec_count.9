.SH NAME
v9fs_dec_count \- helper functon to drop i_nlink.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" v9fs_dec_count
.BI "(struct inode *inode "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "inode" 12
inode whose nlink is being dropped
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

If a directory had nlink <= 2 (including . and ..), then we should not drop
the link count, which indicates the underlying exported fs doesn't maintain
nlink accurately. e.g.
- overlayfs sets nlink to 1 for merged dir
- ext4 (with dir_nlink feature enabled) sets nlink to 1 if a dir has more
than EXT4_LINK_MAX (65000) links.
