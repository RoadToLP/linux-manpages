.BI "(struct net_device *netdev "  ","
.BI "u16 xid "  ","
.BI "struct scatterlist *sgl "  ","
.BI "unsigned int sgc "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "netdev" 12
the corresponding net_device
.IP "xid" 12
the exchange id requesting ddp
.IP "sgl" 12
the scatter-gather list for this request
.IP "sgc" 12
the number of scatter-gather items
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This is the implementation of net_device_ops.ndo_fcoe_ddp_target
and is expected to be called from ULD, e.g., FCP layer of libfc
to set up ddp for the corresponding xid of the given sglist for
the corresponding I/O. The DDP in target mode is a write I/O request
from the initiator.
.SH "RETURN"
1 for success and 0 for no ddp
