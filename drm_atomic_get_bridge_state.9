This function returns the bridge state for the given bridge, allocating it
if needed. It will also grab the relevant bridge lock to make sure that the
state is consistent.

Either the allocated state or the error code encoded into the pointer. When
the error is EDEADLK then the w/w mutex code has detected a deadlock and the
entire atomic sequence must be restarted.
