.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "phydev" 12
phy_device struct
.IP "dev" 12
pointer to the devices device struct
.IP "delay_values" 12
array of delays the PHY supports
.IP "size" 12
the size of the delay array
.IP "is_rx" 12
boolean to indicate to get the rx internal delay
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Returns the index within the array of internal delay passed in.
If the device property is not present then the interface type is checked
if the interface defines use of internal delay then a 1 is returned otherwise
a 0 is returned.
The array must be in ascending order. If PHY does not have an ascending order
array then size = 0 and the value of the delay property is returned.
Return -EINVAL if the delay is invalid or cannot be found.
