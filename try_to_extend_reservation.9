.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" try_to_extend_reservation
.BI "(struct ext2_reserve_window_node *my_rsv "  ","
.BI "struct super_block *sb "  ","
.BI "int size "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "my_rsv" 12
given reservation window
.IP "sb" 12
super block
.IP "size" 12
the delta to extend
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Attempt to expand the reservation window large enough to have
required number of free blocks

Since \fBext2_try_to_allocate\fP will always allocate blocks within
the reservation window range, if the window size is too small,
multiple blocks allocation has to stop at the end of the reservation
window. To make this more efficient, given the total number of
blocks needed and the current size of the window, we try to
expand the reservation window size if necessary on a best-effort
basis before \fBext2_new_blocks\fP tries to allocate blocks.
