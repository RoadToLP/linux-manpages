.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "tcp_conn" 12
the iSCSI TCP connection
.IP "segment" 12
the buffer to transmnit
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function transmits as much of the buffer as
the network layer will accept, and returns the number of
bytes transmitted.

If CRC hashing is enabled, the function will compute the
hash as it goes. When the entire segment has been transmitted,
it will retrieve the hash value and send it as well.
