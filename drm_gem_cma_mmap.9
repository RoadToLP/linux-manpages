.SH NAME
drm_gem_cma_mmap \- memory-map an exported CMA GEM object
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" drm_gem_cma_mmap
.BI "(struct drm_gem_object *obj "  ","
.BI "struct vm_area_struct *vma "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "obj" 12
GEM object
.IP "vma" 12
VMA for the area to be mapped
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function maps a buffer into a userspace process's address space.
In addition to the usual GEM VMA setup it immediately faults in the entire
object instead of using on-demand faulting. Drivers that use the CMA
helpers should set this as their \fIdrm_gem_object_funcs.mmap\fP callback.
.SH "RETURN"
0 on success or a negative error code on failure.
