.SH NAME
lpfc_cmpl_fabric_iocb \- Completion callback function for fabric iocb
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" lpfc_cmpl_fabric_iocb
.BI "(struct lpfc_hba *phba "  ","
.BI "struct lpfc_iocbq *cmdiocb "  ","
.BI "struct lpfc_iocbq *rspiocb "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "phba" 12
pointer to lpfc hba data structure.
.IP "cmdiocb" 12
pointer to lpfc command iocb data structure.
.IP "rspiocb" 12
pointer to lpfc response iocb data structure.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This routine is the callback function that is put to the fabric iocb's
callback function pointer (iocb->iocb_cmpl). The original iocb's callback
function pointer has been stored in iocb->fabric_iocb_cmpl. This callback
function first restores and invokes the original iocb's callback function
and then invokes the \fBlpfc_resume_fabric_iocbs\fP routine to issue the next
fabric bound iocb from the driver internal fabric iocb list onto the wire.
