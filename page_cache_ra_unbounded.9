This function is for filesystems to call when they want to start
readahead beyond a file's stated i_size.  This is almost certainly
not the function you want to call.  Use \fBpage_cache_async_readahead\fP
or \fBpage_cache_sync_readahead\fP instead.
.SH "CONTEXT"
File is referenced by caller.  Mutexes may be held by caller.
May sleep, but will not reenter filesystem to reclaim memory.
