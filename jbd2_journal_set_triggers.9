.SH NAME
jbd2_journal_set_triggers \- Add triggers for commit writeout
.SH SYNOPSIS

.BI "(struct buffer_head *bh "  ","
.BI "struct jbd2_buffer_trigger_type *type "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "bh" 12
buffer to trigger on
.IP "type" 12
struct jbd2_buffer_trigger_type containing the trigger(s).

Set any triggers on this journal_head.  This is always safe, because
triggers for a committing buffer will be saved off, and triggers for
a running transaction will match the buffer in that transaction.

Call with NULL to clear the triggers.
