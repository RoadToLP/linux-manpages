inode to recalc
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
We have to calculate the free blocks since the mm can drop
undirtied hole pages behind our back.

But normally   info->alloced == inode->i_mapping->nrpages + info->swapped
So mm freed is info->alloced - (inode->i_mapping->nrpages + info->swapped)

It has to be called with the spinlock held.
