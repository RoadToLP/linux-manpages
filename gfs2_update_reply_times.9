The glock to update
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This assumes that gl->gl_dstamp has been set earlier.

The rtt (lock round trip time) is an estimate of the time
taken to perform a dlm lock request. We update it on each
reply from the dlm.

The blocking flag is set on the glock for all dlm requests
which may potentially block due to lock requests from other nodes.
DLM requests where the current lock state is exclusive, the
requested state is null (or unlocked) or where the TRY or
TRY_1CB flags are set are classified as non-blocking. All
other DLM requests are counted as (potentially) blocking.
