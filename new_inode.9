Allocates a new inode for given superblock. The default gfp_mask
for allocations related to inode->i_mapping is GFP_HIGHUSER_MOVABLE.
If HIGHMEM pages are unsuitable or it is known that pages allocated
for the page cache are not reclaimable or migratable,
\fBmapping_set_gfp_mask\fP must be called with suitable flags on the
newly created inode's mapping
