.SH NAME
acpi_find_processor_node \- Given a PPTT table find the requested processor
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "struct acpi_pptt_processor *" acpi_find_processor_node
.BI "(struct acpi_table_header *table_hdr "  ","
.BI "u32 acpi_cpu_id "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "table_hdr" 12
Pointer to the head of the PPTT table
.IP "acpi_cpu_id" 12
CPU we are searching for
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Find the subtable entry describing the provided processor.
This is done by iterating the PPTT table looking for processor nodes
which have an acpi_processor_id that matches the acpi_cpu_id parameter
passed into the function. If we find a node that matches this criteria
we verify that its a leaf node in the topology rather than depending
on the valid flag, which doesn't need to be set for leaf nodes.
.SH "RETURN"
NULL, or the processors acpi_pptt_processor*
