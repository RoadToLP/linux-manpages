.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Slimbus specification needs this sequence to turn-off clocks for the bus.
The sequence involves sending 3 broadcast messages (reconfiguration
sequence) to inform all devices on the bus.
To exit clock-pause, controller typically wakes up active framer device.
This API executes clock pause reconfiguration sequence if wakeup is false.
If wakeup is true, controller's wakeup is called.
For entering clock-pause, -EBUSY is returned if a message txn in pending.
