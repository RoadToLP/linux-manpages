.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function does a scan of a LEB, but caters for errors that might have
been caused by unclean reboots from which we are attempting to recover
(assume that only the last log LEB can be corrupted by an unclean reboot).

This function returns 0 on success and a negative error code on failure.
