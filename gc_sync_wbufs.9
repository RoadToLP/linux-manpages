.SH "DESCRIPTION"
We must guarantee that obsoleting nodes are on flash. Unfortunately they may
be in a write-buffer instead. That is, a node could be written to a
write-buffer, obsoleting another node in a LEB that is GC'd. If that LEB is
erased before the write-buffer is sync'd and then there is an unclean
unmount, then an existing node is lost. To avoid this, we sync all
write-buffers.

This function returns 0 on success or a negative error code on failure.
