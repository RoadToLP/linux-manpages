.SH NAME
vm_iomap_memory \- remap memory to userspace
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" vm_iomap_memory
.BI "(struct vm_area_struct *vma "  ","
.BI "phys_addr_t start "  ","
.BI "unsigned long len "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "vma" 12
user vma to map to
.IP "start" 12
start of the physical memory to be mapped
.IP "len" 12
size of area
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This is a simplified \fBio_remap_pfn_range\fP for common driver use. The
driver just needs to give us the physical memory range to be mapped,
we'll figure out the rest from the vma information.

NOTE! Some drivers might want to tweak vma->vm_page_prot first to get
whatever write-combining details or similar.
.SH "RETURN"
0 on success, negative error code otherwise.
