wait for syncronisation pulse.

Start an ADC conversion and wait for the result.  Note that
synchronised ADC conversions (via the ADCSYNC pin) must wait
until the trigger is asserted and the conversion is finished.

This function currently spins waiting for the conversion to
complete (2 frames max without sync).

If called for a synchronised ADC conversion, it may sleep
with the ADC mutex held.
