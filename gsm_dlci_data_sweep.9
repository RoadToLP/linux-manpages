the GSM mux

Sweep the GSM mux channels in priority order looking for ones with
data to send. We could do with optimising this scan a bit. We aim
to fill the queue totally or up to TX_THRESH_HI bytes. Once we hit
TX_THRESH_LO we get called again

FIXME: We should round robin between groups and in theory you can
renegotiate DLCI priorities with optional stuff. Needs optimising.
