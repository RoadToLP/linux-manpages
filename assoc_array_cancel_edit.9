.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" assoc_array_cancel_edit
.BI "(struct assoc_array_edit *edit "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "edit" 12
The script to discard.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Free an edit script and all the preallocated data it holds without making
any changes to the associative array it was intended for.

NOTE!  In the case of an insertion script, this does _not_ release the leaf
that was to be inserted.  That is left to the caller.
