.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "sdata" 12
virtual interface to build the header for
.IP "skb" 12
the skb to build the header in
.IP "info_flags" 12
skb flags to set

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function takes the skb with 802.3 header and reformats the header to
the appropriate IEEE 802.11 header based on which interface the packet is
being transmitted on.

Note that this function also takes care of the TX status request and
potential unsharing of the SKB - this needs to be interleaved with the
header building.

The function requires the read-side RCU lock held
.SH "RETURN"
the (possibly reallocated) skb or an \fBERR_PTR\fP code
