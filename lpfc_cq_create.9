.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "phba" 12
HBA structure that indicates port to create a queue on.
.IP "cq" 12
The queue structure to use to create the completion queue.
.IP "eq" 12
The event queue to bind this completion queue to.
.IP "type" 12
Type of queue (EQ, GCQ, MCQ, WCQ, etc).
.IP "subtype" 12
Functional purpose of the queue (MBOX, IO, ELS, NVMET, etc).
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function creates a completion queue, as detailed in \fIwq\fP, on a port,
described by \fIphba\fP by sending a CQ_CREATE mailbox command to the HBA.

The \fIphba\fP struct is used to send mailbox command to HBA. The \fIcq\fP struct
is used to get the entry count and entry size that are necessary to
determine the number of pages to allocate and use for this queue. The \fIeq\fP
is used to indicate which event queue to bind this completion queue to. This
function will send the CQ_CREATE mailbox command to the HBA to setup the
completion queue. This function is asynchronous and will wait for the mailbox
command to finish before continuing.

On success this function will return a zero. If unable to allocate enough
memory this function will return -ENOMEM. If the queue create mailbox command
fails this function will return -ENXIO.
