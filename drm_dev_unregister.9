Device to unregister
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Unregister the DRM device from the system. This does the reverse of
\fBdrm_dev_register\fP but does not deallocate the device. The caller must call
\fBdrm_dev_put\fP to drop their final reference.

A special form of unregistering for hotpluggable devices is \fBdrm_dev_unplug\fP,
which can be called while there are still open users of \fIdev\fP.

This should be called first in the device teardown code to make sure
userspace can't access the device instance any more.
