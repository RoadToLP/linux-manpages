.SH NAME
xdr_restrict_buflen \- decrease available buffer space
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" xdr_restrict_buflen
.BI "(struct xdr_stream *xdr "  ","
.BI "int newbuflen "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "xdr" 12
pointer to xdr_stream
.IP "newbuflen" 12
new maximum number of bytes available
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Adjust our idea of how much space is available in the buffer.
If we've already used too much space in the buffer, returns -1.
If the available space is already smaller than newbuflen, returns 0
and does nothing.  Otherwise, adjusts xdr->buf->buflen to newbuflen
and ensures xdr->end is set at most offset newbuflen from the start
of the buffer.
