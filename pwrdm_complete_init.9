.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Do whatever is necessary to initialize registered powerdomains and
powerdomain code.  Currently, this programs the next power state
for each powerdomain to ON.  This prevents powerdomains from
unexpectedly losing context or entering high wakeup latency modes
with non-power-management-enabled kernels.  Must be called after
\fBpwrdm_register_pwrdms\fP.  Returns -EACCES if called before
\fBpwrdm_register_pwrdms\fP, or 0 upon success.
