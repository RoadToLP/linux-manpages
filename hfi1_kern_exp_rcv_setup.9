.SH NAME
hfi1_kern_exp_rcv_setup \- setup TID's and flow for one segment of a TID RDMA request
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" hfi1_kern_exp_rcv_setup
.BI "(struct tid_rdma_request *req "  ","
.BI "struct rvt_sge_state *ss "  ","
.BI "bool *last "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "req" 12
TID RDMA request for which the segment/flow is being set up
.IP "ss" 12
sge state, maintains state across successive segments of a sge
.IP "last" 12
set to true after the last sge segment has been processed
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function
(1) finds a free flow entry in the flow circular buffer
(2) finds pages and continuous physical chunks constituing one segment
of an sge
(3) allocates TID group entries for those chunks
(4) programs rcvarray entries in the hardware corresponding to those
TID's
(5) computes a tidarray with formatted TID entries which can be sent
to the sender
(6) Reserves and programs HW flows.
(7) It also manages queing the QP when TID/flow resources are not
available.

\fIreq\fP points to struct tid_rdma_request of which the segments are a part. The
function uses qp, rcd and seg_len members of \fIreq\fP. In the absence of errors,
req->flow_idx is the index of the flow which has been prepared in this
invocation of function call. With flow = \fIreq->flows\fP[req->flow_idx],
flow->tid_entry contains the TID array which the sender can use for TID RDMA
sends and flow->npkts contains number of packets required to send the
segment.

hfi1_check_sge_align should be called prior to calling this function and if
it signals error TID RDMA cannot be used for this sge and this function
should not be called.

For the queuing, caller must hold the flow->req->qp s_lock from the send
engine and the function will procure the exp_lock.
.SH "RETURN"
The function returns -EAGAIN if sufficient number of TID/flow resources to
map the segment could not be allocated. In this case the function should be
called again with previous arguments to retry the TID allocation. There are
no other error returns. The function returns 0 on success.
