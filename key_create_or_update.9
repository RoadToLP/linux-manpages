.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Search the destination keyring for a key of the same description and if one
is found, update it, otherwise create and instantiate a new one and create a
link to it from that keyring.

If perm is KEY_PERM_UNDEF then an appropriate key permissions mask will be
concocted.

Returns a pointer to the new key if successful, -ENODEV if the key type
wasn't available, -ENOTDIR if the keyring wasn't a keyring, -EACCES if the
caller isn't permitted to modify the keyring or the LSM did not permit
creation of the key.

On success, the possession flag from the keyring ref will be tacked on to
the key ref before it is returned.
