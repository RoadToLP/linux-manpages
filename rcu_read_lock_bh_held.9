.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Check for bottom half being disabled, which covers both the
CONFIG_PROVE_RCU and not cases.  Note that if someone uses
\fBrcu_read_lock_bh\fP, but then later enables BH, lockdep (if enabled)
will show the situation.  This is useful for debug checks in functions
that require that they be called within an RCU read-side critical
section.

Check \fBdebug_lockdep_rcu_enabled\fP to prevent false positives during boot.

Note that \fBrcu_read_lock_bh\fP is disallowed if the CPU is either idle or
offline from an RCU perspective, so check for those as well.
