.BI "int eh_disp "  ");"

sd-issued command that has failed
.IP "eh_disp" 12
The recovery disposition suggested by the midlayer

This function is called by the SCSI midlayer upon completion of an
error test command (currently TEST UNIT READY). The result of sending
the eh command is passed in eh_disp.  We're looking for devices that
fail medium access commands but are OK with non access commands like
test unit ready (so wrongly see the device as having a successful
recovery)
