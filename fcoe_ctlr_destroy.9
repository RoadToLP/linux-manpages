.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" fcoe_ctlr_destroy
.BI "(struct fcoe_ctlr *fip "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "fip" 12
The FCoE controller to tear down
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This is called by FCoE drivers before freeing the \fIfcoe_ctlr\fP.

The receive handler will have been deleted before this to guarantee
that no more recv_work will be scheduled.

The timer routine will simply return once we set FIP_ST_DISABLED.
This guarantees that no further timeouts or work will be scheduled.
