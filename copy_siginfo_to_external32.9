.SH NAME
copy_siginfo_to_external32 \- copy a kernel siginfo into a compat user siginfo
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" copy_siginfo_to_external32
.BI "(struct compat_siginfo *to "  ","
.BI "const struct kernel_siginfo *from "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "to" 12
compat siginfo destination
.IP "from" 12
kernel siginfo source
.SH "NOTE"
This function does not work properly for the SIGCHLD on x32, but
fortunately it doesn't have to.  The only valid callers for this function are
copy_siginfo_to_user32, which is overriden for x32 and the coredump code.
The latter does not care because SIGCHLD will never cause a coredump.
