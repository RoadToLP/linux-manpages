.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Mark the start of an update to pipe registers that should be updated
atomically regarding vblank. If the next vblank will happens within
the next 100 us, this function waits until the vblank passes.

After a successful call to this function, interrupts will be disabled
until a subsequent call to \fBintel_pipe_update_end\fP. That is done to
avoid random delays.
