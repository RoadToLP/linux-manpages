.SH NAME
gpiod_export \- export a GPIO through sysfs
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" gpiod_export
.BI "(struct gpio_desc *desc "  ","
.BI "bool direction_may_change "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "desc" 12
GPIO to make available, already requested
.IP "direction_may_change" 12
true if userspace may change GPIO direction
.SH "CONTEXT"
arch_initcall or later
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
When drivers want to make a GPIO accessible to userspace after they
have requested it -- perhaps while debugging, or as part of their
public interface -- they may use this routine.  If the GPIO can
change direction (some can't) and the caller allows it, userspace
will see "direction" sysfs attribute which may be used to change
the gpio's direction.  A "value" attribute will always be provided.

Returns zero on success, else an error.
