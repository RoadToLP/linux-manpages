lpfc_issue_els_fdisc \- Issue a fdisc iocb command
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" lpfc_issue_els_fdisc
.BI "(struct lpfc_vport *vport "  ","
.BI "struct lpfc_nodelist *ndlp "  ","
.BI "uint8_t retry "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "vport" 12
pointer to a virtual N_Port data structure.
.IP "ndlp" 12
pointer to a node-list data structure.
.IP "retry" 12
number of retries to the command IOCB.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This routine prepares and issues a Fabric Discover (FDISC) IOCB to
a remote node (\fIndlp\fP) off a \fIvport\fP. It uses the \fBlpfc_issue_fabric_iocb\fP
routine to issue the IOCB, which makes sure only one outstanding fabric
IOCB will be sent off HBA at any given time.

Note that, in \fBlpfc_prep_els_iocb\fP routine, the reference count of ndlp
will be incremented by 1 for holding the ndlp and the reference to ndlp
will be stored into the context1 field of the IOCB for the completion
callback function to the FDISC ELS command.

Return code
0 - Successfully issued fdisc iocb command
1 - Failed to issue fdisc iocb command
