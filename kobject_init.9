.SH NAME
kobject_init \- Initialize a kobject structure.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" kobject_init
.BI "(struct kobject *kobj "  ","
.BI "struct kobj_type *ktype "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "kobj" 12
pointer to the kobject to initialize
.IP "ktype" 12
pointer to the ktype for this kobject.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function will properly initialize a kobject such that it can then
be passed to the \fBkobject_add\fP call.

After this function is called, the kobject MUST be cleaned up by a call
to \fBkobject_put\fP, not by a call to kfree directly to ensure that all of
the memory is cleaned up properly.
