protocol offload declaration

Add protocol offload handlers to the networking stack. The passed
\fIproto_offload\fP is linked into kernel lists and may not be freed until
it has been removed from the kernel lists.

This call does not sleep therefore it can not
guarantee all CPU's that are in middle of receiving packets
will see the new offload handlers (until the next received packet).
