.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Prepare a new set of task credentials for modification.  A task's creds
shouldn't generally be modified directly, therefore this function is used to
prepare a new copy, which the caller then modifies and then commits by
calling \fBcommit_creds\fP.

Preparation involves making a copy of the objective creds for modification.

Returns a pointer to the new creds-to-be if successful, NULL otherwise.

Call \fBcommit_creds\fP or \fBabort_creds\fP to clean up.
