.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH ARGUMENTS

button data for button to be disabled
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Disables button pointed by \fIbdata\fP. This is done by masking
IRQ line. After this function is called, button won't generate
input events anymore. Note that one can only disable buttons
that don't share IRQs.

Make sure that \fIbdata->disable_lock\fP is locked when entering
this function to avoid races when concurrent threads are
disabling buttons at the same time.
