.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Increment the usecount of the clockdomain \fIclkdm\fP and ensure that it
is awake before \fIclk\fP is enabled.  Intended to be called by
\fBclk_enable\fP code.  If the clockdomain is in software-supervised
idle mode, force the clockdomain to wake.  If the clockdomain is in
hardware-supervised idle mode, add clkdm-pwrdm autodependencies, to
ensure that devices in the clockdomain can be read from/written to
by on-chip processors.  Returns -EINVAL if passed null pointers;
returns 0 upon success or if the clockdomain is in hwsup idle mode.
