.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function retrieves struct uart_8250_port for the specific line.
This struct *must* *not* be used to perform a 8250 or serial core operation
which is not accessible otherwise. Its only purpose is to make the struct
accessible to the runtime-pm callbacks for context suspend/restore.
The lock assumption made here is none because runtime-pm suspend/resume
callbacks should not be invoked if there is any operation performed on the
port.
