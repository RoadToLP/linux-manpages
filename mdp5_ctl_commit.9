.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "ctl" 12
the CTL instance
.IP "pipeline" 12
the encoder's INTF + MIXER configuration
.IP "flush_mask" 12
bitmask of display controller hw blocks to flush
.IP "start" 12
if true, immediately update flush registers and set START
bit, otherwise accumulate flush_mask bits until we are
ready to START
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The flush register is used to indicate several registers are all
programmed, and are safe to update to the back copy of the double
buffered registers.

Some registers FLUSH bits are shared when the hardware does not have
dedicated bits for them; handling these is the job of \fBfix_sw_flush\fP.

CTL registers need to be flushed in some circumstances; if that is the
case, some trigger bits will be present in both flush mask and
ctl->pending_ctl_trigger.

Return H/W flushed bit mask.
