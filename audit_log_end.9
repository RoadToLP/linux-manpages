.SH NAME
audit_log_end \- end one audit record
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" audit_log_end
.BI "(struct audit_buffer *ab "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "ab" 12
the audit_buffer
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
We can not do a netlink send inside an irq context because it blocks (last
arg, flags, is not set to MSG_DONTWAIT), so the audit buffer is placed on a
queue and a kthread is scheduled to remove them from the queue outside the
irq context.  May be called in any context.
