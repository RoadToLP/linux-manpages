.SH NAME
crc7_be \- update the CRC7 for the data buffer
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "u8" crc7_be
.BI "(u8 crc "  ","
.BI "const u8 *buffer "  ","
.BI "size_t len "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "crc" 12
previous CRC7 value
.IP "buffer" 12
data pointer
.IP "len" 12
number of bytes in the buffer
.SH "CONTEXT"

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Returns the updated CRC7 value.
The CRC7 is left-aligned in the byte (the lsbit is always 0), as that
makes the computation easier, and all callers want it in that form.
