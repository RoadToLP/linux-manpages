.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Take care of cleaning up after all DRM clients have exited.  In the
mode setting case, we want to restore the kernel's initial mode (just
in case the last client left us in a bad state).

Additionally, in the non-mode setting case, we'll tear down the GTT
and DMA structures, since the kernel won't be using them, and clea
up any GEM state.
