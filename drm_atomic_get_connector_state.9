.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function returns the connector state for the given connector,
allocating it if needed. It will also grab the relevant connector lock to
make sure that the state is consistent.

Either the allocated state or the error code encoded into the pointer. When
the error is EDEADLK then the w/w mutex code has detected a deadlock and the
entire atomic sequence must be restarted. All other errors are fatal.
