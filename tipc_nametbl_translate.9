.IP "type" 12

the search domain used during translation
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
On exit:
- if translation is deferred to another node, leave 'dnode' unchanged and
return 0
- if translation is attempted and succeeds, set 'dnode' to the publishing
node and return the published (non-zero) port number
- if translation is attempted and fails, set 'dnode' to 0 and return 0

Note that for legacy users (node configured with Z.C.N address format) the
'closest-first' lookup algorithm must be maintained, i.e., if dnode is 0
we must look in the local binding list first
