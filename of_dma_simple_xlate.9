.BI "(struct of_phandle_args *dma_spec "  ","
.BI "struct of_dma *ofdma "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dma_spec" 12
pointer to DMA specifier as found in the device tree
.IP "ofdma" 12
pointer to DMA controller data
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
A simple translation function for devices that use a 32-bit value for the
filter_param when calling the DMA engine \fBdma_request_channel\fP function.
Note that this translation function requires that #dma-cells is equal to 1
and the argument of the dma specifier is the 32-bit filter_param. Returns
pointer to appropriate dma channel on success or NULL on error.
