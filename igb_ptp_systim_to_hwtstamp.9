unsigned 64bit system time value.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
We need to convert the system time value stored in the RX/TXSTMP registers
into a hwtstamp which can be used by the upper level timestamping functions.

The 'tmreg_lock' spinlock is used to protect the consistency of the
system time value. This is needed because reading the 64 bit time
value involves reading two (or three) 32 bit registers. The first
read latches the value. Ditto for writing.

In addition, here have extended the system time with an overflow
counter in software.
