.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" handle_fasteoi_nmi
.BI "(struct irq_desc *desc "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "desc" 12
the interrupt description structure for this irq

A simple NMI-safe handler, considering the restrictions
from request_nmi.

Only a single callback will be issued to the chip: an ->\fBeoi\fP
call when the interrupt has been serviced. This enables support
for modern forms of interrupt handlers, which handle the flow
details in hardware, transparently.
