.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This routine is to be registered to the kernel's PCI subsystem. When an
Emulex HBA is removed from PCI bus, the driver core invokes this routine.
This routine dispatches the action to the proper SLI-3 or SLI-4 device
remove routine, which will perform all the necessary cleanup for the
device to be removed from the PCI subsystem properly.
