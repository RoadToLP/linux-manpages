.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This is called before connection establishment is started. For passive connections, when
listener is created, it will call with entry type of  I40IW_QHASH_TYPE_TCP_SYN with local
ip address and tcp port. When SYN is received (passive connections) or
sent (active connections), this routine is called with entry type of
I40IW_QHASH_TYPE_TCP_ESTABLISHED and quad is passed in info.

When iwarp connection is done and its state moves to RTS, the quad hash entry in
the hardware will point to iwarp's qp number and requires no calls from the driver.
