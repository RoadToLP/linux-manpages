.SH NAME
__host1x_client_register \- register a host1x client
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" __host1x_client_register
.BI "(struct host1x_client *client "  ","
.BI "struct lock_class_key *key "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "client" 12
host1x client
.IP "key" 12
lock class key for the client-specific mutex
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Registers a host1x client with each host1x controller instance. Note that
each client will only match their parent host1x controller and will only be
associated with that instance. Once all clients have been registered with
their parent host1x controller, the infrastructure will set up the logical
device and call \fBhost1x_device_init\fP, which will in turn call each client's
\fIhost1x_client_ops.init\fP implementation.
