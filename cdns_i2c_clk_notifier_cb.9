.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function is called when the cdns_i2c input clock frequency changes.
The callback checks whether a valid bus frequency can be generated after the
change. If so, the change is acknowledged, otherwise the change is aborted.
New dividers are written to the HW in the pre- or post change notification
depending on the scaling direction.
.SH "RETURN"
NOTIFY_STOP if the rate change should be aborted, NOTIFY_OK
to acknowledge the change, NOTIFY_DONE if the notification is
considered irrelevant.
