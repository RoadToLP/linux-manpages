.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Convert a dentry into an ASCII path name. If the entry has been deleted
the string " (deleted)" is appended. Note that this is ambiguous.

Returns a pointer into the buffer or an error code if the path was
too long. Note: Callers should use the returned pointer, not the passed
in buffer, to use the name! The implementation often starts at an offset
into the buffer, and may leave 0 bytes at the start.

"buflen" should be positive.
