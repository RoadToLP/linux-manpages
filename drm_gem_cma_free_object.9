GEM object to free
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function frees the backing memory of the CMA GEM object, cleans up the
GEM object state and frees the memory used to store the object itself.
If the buffer is imported and the virtual address is set, it is released.
Drivers using the CMA helpers should set this as their
\fIdrm_gem_object_funcs.free\fP callback.
