tty_ldisc_hangup \- hangup ldisc reset
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" tty_ldisc_hangup
.BI "(struct tty_struct *tty "  ","
.BI "bool reinit "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "tty" 12
tty being hung up
.IP "reinit" 12
whether to re-initialise the tty

Some tty devices reset their termios when they receive a hangup
event. In that situation we must also switch back to N_TTY properly
before we reset the termios data.

Locking: We can take the ldisc mutex as the rest of the code is
careful to allow for this.

In the pty pair case this occurs in the \fBclose\fP path of the
tty itself so we must be careful about locking rules.
