.SH NAME
e1000_write_nvm_eewr_82571 \- Write to EEPROM for 82573 silicon
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "s32" e1000_write_nvm_eewr_82571
.BI "(struct e1000_hw *hw "  ","
.BI "u16 offset "  ","
.BI "u16 words "  ","
.BI "u16 *data "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "hw" 12
pointer to the HW structure
.IP "offset" 12
offset within the EEPROM to be written to
.IP "words" 12
number of words to write
.IP "data" 12
16 bit word(s) to be written to the EEPROM

After checking for invalid values, poll the EEPROM to ensure the previous
command has completed before trying to write the next word.  After write
poll for completion.

If e1000e_update_nvm_checksum is not called after this function, the
EEPROM will most likely contain an invalid checksum.
