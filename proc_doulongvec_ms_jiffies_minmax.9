.BI "(struct ctl_table *table "  ","
.BI "int write "  ","
.BI "void *buffer "  ","
.BI "size_t *lenp "  ","

.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "table" 12
the sysctl table
.IP "write" 12
TRUE if this is a write to the sysctl file
.IP "buffer" 12
the user buffer
.IP "lenp" 12
the size of the user buffer
.IP "ppos" 12
file position
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Reads/writes up to table->maxlen/sizeof(unsigned long) unsigned long
values from/to the user buffer, treated as an ASCII string. The values
are treated as milliseconds, and converted to jiffies when they are stored.

This routine will ensure the values are within the range specified by
table->extra1 (min) and table->extra2 (max).

Returns 0 on success.
