.BI "(struct rt_mutex *lock "  ","
.BI "struct rt_mutex_waiter *waiter "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "lock" 12

the pre-initialized rt_mutex_waiter
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Attempt to clean up after a failed \fB__rt_mutex_start_proxy_lock\fP or
\fBrt_mutex_wait_proxy_lock\fP.

Unless we acquired the lock; we're still enqueued on the wait-list and can
in fact still be granted ownership until we're removed. Therefore we can
find we are in fact the owner and must disregard the
\fBrt_mutex_wait_proxy_lock\fP failure.

Special API call for PI-futex support
.SH "RETURN"
true  - did the cleanup, we done.
false - we acquired the lock after \fBrt_mutex_wait_proxy_lock\fP returned,
caller should disregards its return value.
