.SH NAME
ef4_fast_push_rx_descriptors \- push new RX descriptors quickly
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" ef4_fast_push_rx_descriptors
.BI "(struct ef4_rx_queue *rx_queue "  ","
.BI "bool atomic "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "rx_queue" 12
RX descriptor queue
.IP "atomic" 12
control memory allocation flags
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This will aim to fill the RX descriptor queue up to
\fIrx_queue\fP->\fImax_fill\fP. If there is insufficient atomic
memory to do so, a slow fill will be scheduled.
The caller must provide serialisation (none is used here). In practise,
this means this function must run from the NAPI handler, or be called
when NAPI is disabled.
