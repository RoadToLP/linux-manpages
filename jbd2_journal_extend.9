.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Some transactions, such as large extends and truncates, can be done
atomically all at once or in several stages.  The operation requests
a credit for a number of buffer modifications in advance, but can
extend its credit if it needs more.

jbd2_journal_extend tries to give the running handle more buffer credits.
It does not guarantee that allocation - this is a best-effort only.
The calling process MUST be able to deal cleanly with a failure to
extend here.

Return 0 on success, non-zero on failure.

return code < 0 implies an error
return code > 0 implies normal transaction-full status.
