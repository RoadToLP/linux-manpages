probe_irq_mask \- scan a bitmap of interrupt lines
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "unsigned int" probe_irq_mask
.BI "(unsigned long val "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "val" 12
mask of interrupts to consider

Scan the interrupt lines and return a bitmap of active
autodetect interrupts. The interrupt probe logic state
is then returned to its previous value.
.SH "NOTE"
we need to scan all the irq's even though we will
only return autodetect irq numbers - just so that we reset
them all to a known state.
