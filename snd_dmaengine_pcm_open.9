.B "int" snd_dmaengine_pcm_open
.BI "(struct snd_pcm_substream *substream "  ","

.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "substream" 12
PCM substream

DMA channel to use for data transfers
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Returns 0 on success, a negative error code otherwise.

The function should usually be called from the pcm open callback. Note that
this function will use private_data field of the substream's runtime. So it
is not available to your pcm driver implementation.
