packet type declaration

Remove a protocol handler that was previously added to the kernel
protocol handlers by \fBdev_add_pack\fP. The passed \fIpacket_type\fP is removed
from the kernel lists and can be freed or reused once this function
returns.

The packet type might still be in use by receivers
and must not be freed until after all the CPU's have gone
through a quiescent state.
