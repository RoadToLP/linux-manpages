.SH NAME
clkdm_register_autodeps \- register autodeps (if required)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" clkdm_register_autodeps
.BI "(struct clkdm_autodep *ia "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "ia" 12
pointer to a static array of struct clkdm_autodep to register
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Register clockdomain "automatic dependencies."  These are
clockdomain wakeup and sleep dependencies that are automatically
added whenever the first clock inside a clockdomain is enabled, and
removed whenever the last clock inside a clockdomain is disabled.
These are currently only used on OMAP3 devices, and are deprecated,
since they waste energy.  However, until the OMAP2/3 IP block
enable/disable sequence can be converted to match the OMAP4
sequence, they are needed.

Must be called only after all of the SoC clockdomains are
registered, since the function will resolve autodep clockdomain
names into clockdomain pointers.

The struct clkdm_autodep \fIia\fP array must be static, as this function
does not copy the array elements.

Returns -EACCES if called before any clockdomains have been
registered, -EINVAL if called with a null \fIia\fP argument, -EEXIST if
autodeps have already been registered, or 0 upon success.
