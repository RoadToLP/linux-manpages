.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This routine should be called when a device is removed from
a running system (e.g. by hotplug or dlpar).  It unregisters
the PCI device from the EEH subsystem.  I/O errors affecting
this device will no longer be detected after this call; thus,
i/o errors affecting this slot may leave this device unusable.
