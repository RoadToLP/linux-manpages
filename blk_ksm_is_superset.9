.SH NAME
blk_ksm_is_superset \- Check if a KSM supports a superset of crypto modes and DUN bytes that another KSM supports. Here, "superset" refers to the mathematical meaning of the word - i.e. if two KSMs have the *same* capabilities, they *are* considered supersets of each other.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "bool" blk_ksm_is_superset
.BI "(struct blk_keyslot_manager *ksm_superset "  ","
.BI "struct blk_keyslot_manager *ksm_subset "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "ksm_superset" 12
The KSM that we want to verify is a superset
.IP "ksm_subset" 12
The KSM that we want to verify is a subset
.SH "RETURN"
True if \fIksm_superset\fP supports a superset of the crypto modes and DUN
bytes that \fIksm_subset\fP supports.
