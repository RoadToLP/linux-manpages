.SH NAME
snapshot_write_next \- Get the address to store the next image page.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" snapshot_write_next
.BI "(struct snapshot_handle *handle "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "handle" 12
Snapshot handle structure to guide the writing.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
On the first call, \fIhandle\fP should point to a zeroed snapshot_handle
structure.  The structure gets populated then and a pointer to it should be
passed to this function every next time.

On success, the function returns a positive number.  Then, the caller
is allowed to write up to the returned number of bytes to the memory
location computed by the \fBdata_of\fP macro.

The function returns 0 to indicate the "end of file" condition.  Negative
numbers are returned on errors, in which cases the structure pointed to by
\fIhandle\fP is not updated and should not be used any more.
