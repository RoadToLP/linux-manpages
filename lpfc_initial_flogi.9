.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" lpfc_initial_flogi
.BI "(struct lpfc_vport *vport "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "vport" 12
pointer to a host virtual N_Port data structure.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This routine issues an initial Fabric Login (FLOGI) for the \fIvport\fP
specified. It first searches the ndlp with the Fabric_DID (0xfffffe) from
the \fIvport\fP's ndlp list. If no such ndlp found, it will create an ndlp and
put it into the \fIvport\fP's ndlp list. If an inactive ndlp found on the list,
it will just be enabled and made active. The \fBlpfc_issue_els_flogi\fP routine
is then invoked with the \fIvport\fP and the ndlp to perform the FLOGI for the
\fIvport\fP.

Return code
0 - failed to issue initial flogi for \fIvport\fP
1 - successfully issued initial flogi for \fIvport\fP
