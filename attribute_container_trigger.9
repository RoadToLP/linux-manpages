.SH NAME
attribute_container_trigger \- trigger a function for each matching container
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" attribute_container_trigger
.BI "(struct device *dev "  ","
.BI "int (*fn)(struct attribute_container *, struct device *) "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dev" 12
The generic device to activate the trigger for
.IP "fn" 12
the function to trigger
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This routine triggers a function that only needs to know the
matching containers (not the classdev) associated with a device.
It is more lightweight than attribute_container_device_trigger, so
should be used in preference unless the triggering function
actually needs to know the classdev.
