.BI "(struct asd_ha_struct *asd_ha "  ","
.BI "struct asd_ascb *ascb "  ","
.BI "int num "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "asd_ha" 12
pointer to a host adapter structure

.IP "num" 12

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
See queueing comment in \fBasd_post_escb_list\fP.

Additional note on queuing: In order to minimize the ratio of \fBmemcpy\fP
to the number of ascbs sent, we try to batch-send as many ascbs as possible
in one go.
Two cases are possible:
A) can_queue >= num,
B) can_queue < num.
Case A: we can send the whole batch at once.  Increment "pending"
in the beginning of this function, when it is checked, in order to
eliminate races when this function is called by multiple processes.
Case B: should never happen.
