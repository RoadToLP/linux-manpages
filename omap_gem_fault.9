fault detail
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Invoked when a fault occurs on an mmap of a GEM managed area. GEM
does most of the work for us including the actual map/unmap calls
but we need to do the actual page work.

The VMA was set up by GEM. In doing so it also ensured that the
vma->vm_private_data points to the GEM object that is backing this
mapping.
