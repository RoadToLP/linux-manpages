.SH NAME
clear_event_triggers \- Clear all triggers associated with a trace array
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" clear_event_triggers
.BI "(struct trace_array *tr "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "tr" 12
The trace array to clear
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
For each trigger, the triggering event has its tm_ref decremented
via \fBtrace_event_trigger_enable_disable\fP, and any associated event
(in the case of enable/disable_event triggers) will have its sm_ref
decremented via \fBfree\fP->\fBtrace_event_enable_disable\fP.  That
combination effectively reverses the soft-mode/trigger state added
by trigger registration.

Must be called with event_mutex held.
