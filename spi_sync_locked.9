.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" spi_sync_locked

device with which data will be exchanged

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This call may only be used from a context that may sleep.  The sleep
is non-interruptible, and has no timeout.  Low-overhead controller
drivers may DMA directly into and out of the message buffers.

This call should be used by drivers that require exclusive access to the
SPI bus. It has to be preceded by a spi_bus_lock call. The SPI bus must
be released by a spi_bus_unlock call when the exclusive access is over.
.SH "RETURN"
zero on success, else a negative error code.
