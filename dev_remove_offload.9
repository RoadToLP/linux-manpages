packet offload declaration

Remove a packet offload handler that was previously added to the kernel
offload handlers by \fBdev_add_offload\fP. The passed \fIoffload_type\fP is
removed from the kernel lists and can be freed or reused once this
function returns.

This call sleeps to guarantee that no CPU is looking at the packet
type after return.
