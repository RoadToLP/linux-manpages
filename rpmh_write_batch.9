.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Write a request to the RSC controller without caching. If the request
state is ACTIVE, then the requests are treated as completion request
and sent to the controller immediately. The function waits until all the
commands are complete. If the request was to SLEEP or WAKE_ONLY, then the
request is sent as fire-n-forget and no ack is expected.

May sleep. Do not call from atomic contexts for ACTIVE_ONLY requests.
