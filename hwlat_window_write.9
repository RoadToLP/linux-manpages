.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function provides a write implementation for the "window" interface
to the hardware latency detector. The window is the total time
in us that will be considered one sample period. Conceptually, windows
occur back-to-back and contain a sample width period during which
actual sampling occurs. Can be used to write a new total window size. It
is enforced that any value written must be greater than the sample width
size, or an error results.
