.SH NAME
ssam_device_get_match_data \- Find the ID matching the device in the ID table of the bound driver and return its ``driver_data`` member.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "const void *" ssam_device_get_match_data
.BI "(const struct ssam_device *dev "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dev" 12
The device for which to get the match data.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Find the fist match for the UID of the device in the ID table of the
corresponding driver and return its driver_data. Returns NULL if the
device does not have a driver bound to it, the driver does not have
match_table (i.e. it is NULL), there is no match in the driver's
match_table, or the match does not have any driver_data.

This function essentially calls \fBssam_device_get_match\fP and, if any match
could be found, returns its ``struct ssam_device_id.driver_data`` member.
.SH "RETURN"
Returns the driver data associated with the first match for the UID
of the device in the device driver's match table, or NULL if no such match
could be found.
