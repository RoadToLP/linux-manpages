.SH NAME
lpfc_sli4_new_fcf_random_select \- Randomly select an eligible new fcf record
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "bool" lpfc_sli4_new_fcf_random_select
.BI "(struct lpfc_hba *phba "  ","
.BI "uint32_t fcf_cnt "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "phba" 12
pointer to lpfc hba data structure.
.IP "fcf_cnt" 12
number of eligible fcf record seen so far.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function makes an running random selection decision on FCF record to
use through a sequence of \fIfcf_cnt\fP eligible FCF records with equal
probability. To perform integer manunipulation of random numbers with
size unit32_t, the lower 16 bits of the 32-bit random number returned
from \fBprandom_u32\fP are taken as the random random number generated.

Returns true when outcome is for the newly read FCF record should be
chosen; otherwise, return false when outcome is for keeping the previously
chosen FCF record.
