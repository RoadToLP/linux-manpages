.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Unload the watchdog. You cannot do this with any file handles open.
If your watchdog is set to continue ticking on close and you unload
it, well it keeps ticking. We won't get the interrupt but the board
will not touch PC memory so all is fine. You just have to load a new
module in 60 seconds or reboot.
