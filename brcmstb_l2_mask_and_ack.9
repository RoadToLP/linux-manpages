Chip has separate enable/disable registers instead of a single mask
register and pending interrupt is acknowledged by setting a bit.

e.g.: https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/9831047/
.SH "NOTE"
This function is generic and could easily be added to the
generic irqchip implementation if there ever becomes a will to do so.
Perhaps with a name like \fBirq_gc_mask_disable_and_ack_set\fP.
