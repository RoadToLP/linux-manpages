.SH NAME
qib_set_mtu \- set the MTU
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" qib_set_mtu
.BI "(struct qib_pportdata *ppd "  ","
.BI "u16 arg "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "ppd" 12
the perport data
.IP "arg" 12
the new MTU
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
We can handle "any" incoming size, the issue here is whether we
need to restrict our outgoing size.   For now, we don't do any
sanity checking on this, and we don't deal with what happens to
programs that are already running when the size changes.
.SH "NOTE"
changing the MTU will usually cause the IBC to go back to
link INIT state...
