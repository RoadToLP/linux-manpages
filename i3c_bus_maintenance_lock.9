I3C bus to take the lock on
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function takes the bus lock so that no other operations can occur on
the bus. This is needed for all kind of bus maintenance operation, like
- enabling/disabling slave events
- re-triggering DAA
- changing the dynamic address of a device
- relinquishing mastership
- ...

The reason for this kind of locking is that we don't want drivers and core
logic to rely on I3C device information that could be changed behind their
back.
