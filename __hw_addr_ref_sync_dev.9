.SH NAME
__hw_addr_ref_sync_dev \- Synchronize device's multicast address list taking into account references
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" __hw_addr_ref_sync_dev
.BI "(struct netdev_hw_addr_list *list "  ","
.BI "struct net_device *dev "  ","
.BI "int (*sync)(struct net_device *, const unsigned char *, int) "  ","
.BI "int (*unsync)(struct net_device *, const unsigned char *, int) "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "list" 12
address list to synchronize
.IP "dev" 12
device to sync
.IP "sync" 12
function to call if address or reference on it should be added
.IP "unsync" 12
function to call if address or some reference on it should removed

This function is intended to be called from the ndo_set_rx_mode
function of devices that require explicit address or references on it
add/remove notifications. The unsync function may be NULL in which case
the addresses or references on it requiring removal will simply be
removed without any notification to the device. That is responsibility of
the driver to identify and distribute address or references on it between
internal address tables.
