.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" ubifs_tnc_lookup_dh
.BI "(struct ubifs_info *c "  ","
.BI "const union ubifs_key *key "  ","
.BI "void *node "  ","
.BI "uint32_t cookie "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "c" 12
UBIFS file-system description object
.IP "key" 12
node key to lookup
.IP "node" 12
the node is returned here
.IP "cookie" 12
node cookie for collision resolution
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function looks up and reads a node which contains name hash in the key.
Since the hash may have collisions, there may be many nodes with the same
key, so we have to sequentially look to all of them until the needed one
with the same cookie value is found.
This function returns zero in case of success, -ENOENT if the node
was not found, and a negative error code in case of failure.
