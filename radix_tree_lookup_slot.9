the slot corresponding to the position \fIindex\fP in the
radix tree \fIroot\fP. This is useful for update-if-exists operations.

This function can be called under rcu_read_lock iff the slot is not
modified by radix_tree_replace_slot, otherwise it must be called
exclusive from other writers. Any dereference of the slot must be done
using radix_tree_deref_slot.
