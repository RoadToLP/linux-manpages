.SH NAME
comedi_legacy_detach \- A generic (*detach) function for legacy drivers
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" comedi_legacy_detach
.BI "(struct comedi_device *dev "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dev" 12
COMEDI device.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This is a simple, generic 'detach' handler for legacy COMEDI devices that
just use a single I/O port region and possibly an IRQ and that don't need
any special clean-up for their private device or subdevice storage.  It
can also be called by a driver-specific 'detach' handler.

If \fIdev->irq\fP is non-zero, the IRQ will be freed.  If \fIdev->iobase\fP and
\fIdev->iolen\fP are both non-zero, the I/O port region will be released.
