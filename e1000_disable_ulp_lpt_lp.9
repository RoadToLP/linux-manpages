.SH NAME
e1000_disable_ulp_lpt_lp \- unconfigure Ultra Low Power mode for LynxPoint-LP
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "s32" e1000_disable_ulp_lpt_lp
.BI "(struct e1000_hw *hw "  ","
.BI "bool force "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "hw" 12
pointer to the HW structure
.IP "force" 12
boolean indicating whether or not to force disabling ULP

Un-configure ULP mode when link is up, the system is transitioned from
Sx or the driver is unloaded.  If on a Manageability Engine (ME) enabled
system, poll for an indication from ME that ULP has been un-configured.
If not on an ME enabled system, un-configure the ULP mode by software.

During nominal operation, this function is called when link is acquired
to disable ULP mode (force=false); otherwise, for example when unloading
the driver or during Sx->S0 transitions, this is called with force=true
to forcibly disable ULP.
