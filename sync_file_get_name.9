.SH NAME
sync_file_get_name \- get the name of the sync_file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "char *" sync_file_get_name
.BI "(struct sync_file *sync_file "  ","
.BI "char *buf "  ","
.BI "int len "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "sync_file" 12
sync_file to get the fence from
.IP "buf" 12
destination buffer to copy sync_file name into
.IP "len" 12
available size of destination buffer.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Each sync_file may have a name assigned either by the user (when merging
sync_files together) or created from the fence it contains. In the latter
case construction of the name is deferred until use, and so requires
\fBsync_file_get_name\fP.
.SH "RETURN"
a string representing the name.
