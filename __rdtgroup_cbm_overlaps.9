.SH NAME
__rdtgroup_cbm_overlaps \- Does CBM for intended closid overlap with other
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "bool" __rdtgroup_cbm_overlaps
.BI "(struct rdt_resource *r "  ","
.BI "struct rdt_domain *d "  ","
.BI "unsigned long cbm "  ","
.BI "int closid "  ","
.BI "bool exclusive "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "r" 12
Resource to which domain instance \fId\fP belongs.
.IP "d" 12
The domain instance for which \fIclosid\fP is being tested.
.IP "cbm" 12
Capacity bitmask being tested.
.IP "closid" 12
Intended closid for \fIcbm\fP.
.IP "exclusive" 12
Only check if overlaps with exclusive resource groups
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Checks if provided \fIcbm\fP intended to be used for \fIclosid\fP on domain
\fId\fP overlaps with any other closids or other hardware usage associated
with this domain. If \fIexclusive\fP is true then only overlaps with
resource groups in exclusive mode will be considered. If \fIexclusive\fP
is false then overlaps with any resource group or hardware entities
will be considered.

\fIcbm\fP is unsigned long, even if only 32 bits are used, to make the
bitmap functions work correctly.
.SH "RETURN"
false if CBM does not overlap, true if it does.
