.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "pnvme_lport" 12
Transport localport that LS is to be issued from
.IP "qidx" 12
An cpu index used to affinitize IO queues and MSIX vectors.
.IP "qsize" 12
Size of the queue in bytes
.IP "handle" 12
An opaque driver handle used in follow-up calls.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Driver registers this routine to preallocate and initialize any
internal data structures to bind the \fIqidx\fP to its internal IO queues.
A hardware queue maps (qidx) to a specific driver MSI-X vector/EQ/CQ/WQ.

Return value :
0 - Success
-EINVAL - Unsupported input value.
-ENOMEM - Could not alloc necessary memory
