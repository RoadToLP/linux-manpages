.SH NAME
cgroup_migrate \- migrate a process or task to a cgroup
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" cgroup_migrate
.BI "(struct task_struct *leader "  ","
.BI "bool threadgroup "  ","
.BI "struct cgroup_mgctx *mgctx "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "leader" 12
the leader of the process or the task to migrate
.IP "threadgroup" 12
whether \fIleader\fP points to the whole process or a single task
.IP "mgctx" 12
migration context
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Migrate a process or task denoted by \fIleader\fP.  If migrating a process,
the caller must be holding cgroup_threadgroup_rwsem.  The caller is also
responsible for invoking \fBcgroup_migrate_add_src\fP and
\fBcgroup_migrate_prepare_dst\fP on the targets before invoking this
function and following up with \fBcgroup_migrate_finish\fP.

As long as a controller's ->\fBcan_attach\fP doesn't fail, this function is
guaranteed to succeed.  This means that, excluding ->\fBcan_attach\fP
failure, when migrating multiple targets, the success or failure can be
decided for all targets by invoking \fBgroup_migrate_prepare_dst\fP before
actually starting migrating.
