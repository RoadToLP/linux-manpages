.SH "DESCRIPTION"
By default we select char/ for new entries.  Setting class->dev_obj
to NULL prevents an entry from being created.  class->dev_kobj must
be set (or cleared) before any devices are registered to the class
otherwise \fBdevice_create_sys_dev_entry\fP and
\fBdevice_remove_sys_dev_entry\fP will disagree about the presence of
the link.
