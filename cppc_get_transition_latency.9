.SH "DESCRIPTION"

ACPI CPPC does not explicitly specifiy how a platform can specify the
transition latency for perfromance change requests. The closest we have
is the timing information from the PCCT tables which provides the info
on the number and frequency of PCC commands the platform can handle.
