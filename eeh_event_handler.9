.SH "DESCRIPTION"

The detection of a frozen slot can occur inside an interrupt,
where it can be hard to do anything about it.  The goal of this
routine is to pull these detection events out of the context
of the interrupt handler, and re-dispatch them for processing
at a later time in a normal context.
