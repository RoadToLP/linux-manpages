.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This handler is invoked by the OMAP mailbox driver whenever a mailbox
message is received. Usually, the mailbox payload simply contains
the index of the virtqueue that is kicked by the remote processor,
and we let remoteproc core handle it.

In addition to virtqueue indices, we also have some out-of-band values
that indicate different events. Those values are deliberately very
large so they don't coincide with virtqueue indices.
