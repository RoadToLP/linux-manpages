.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Sleeps until it is safe for the host CPU to access the previously mapped
memory regions. This guarantees that registered MRs are properly fenced
from the server before the RPC consumer accesses the data in them. It
also ensures proper Send flow control: waking the next RPC waits until
this RPC has relinquished all its Send Queue entries.
