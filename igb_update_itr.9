.SH NAME
igb_update_itr \- update the dynamic ITR value based on statistics
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" igb_update_itr
.BI "(struct igb_q_vector *q_vector "  ","
.BI "struct igb_ring_container *ring_container "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "q_vector" 12
pointer to q_vector
.IP "ring_container" 12
ring info to update the itr for

Stores a new ITR value based on packets and byte
counts during the last interrupt.  The advantage of per interrupt
computation is faster updates and more accurate ITR for the current
traffic pattern.  Constants in this function were computed
based on theoretical maximum wire speed and thresholds were set based
on testing data as well as attempting to minimize response time
while increasing bulk throughput.
This functionality is controlled by ethtool's coalescing settings.
.SH "NOTE"
These calculations are only valid when operating in a single-
queue environment.
