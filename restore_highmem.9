.SH "DESCRIPTION"

For each highmem page that was in use before hibernation and is included in
the image, and also has been allocated by the "restore" kernel, swap its
current contents with the previous (ie. "before hibernation") ones.

If the restore eventually fails, we can call this function once again and
restore the highmem state as seen by the restore kernel.
