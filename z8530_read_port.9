z8530_read_port \- Architecture specific interface function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" z8530_read_port
.BI "(unsigned long p "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "p" 12
port to read

Provided port access methods. The Comtrol SV11 requires no delays
between accesses and uses PC I/O. Some drivers may need a 5uS delay

In the longer term this should become an architecture specific
section so that this can become a generic driver interface for all
platforms. For now we only handle PC I/O ports with or without the
dread 5uS sanity delay.

The caller must hold sufficient locks to avoid violating the horrible
5uS delay rule.
