.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" ioasid_register_allocator
.BI "(struct ioasid_allocator_ops *ops "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "ops" 12
the custom allocator ops to be registered
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Custom allocators take precedence over the default xarray based allocator.
Private data associated with the IOASID allocated by the custom allocators
are managed by IOASID framework similar to data stored in xa by default
allocator.

There can be multiple allocators registered but only one is active. In case
of runtime removal of a custom allocator, the next one is activated based
on the registration ordering.

Multiple allocators can share the same \fBalloc\fP function, in this case the
IOASID space is shared.
