.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Current thread must be a kthread. The thread is running jobs on behalf of
other threads. In some cases, we expect the jobs attach cgroup info of
original threads instead of that of current thread. This function stores
original thread's cgroup info in current kthread context for later
retrieval.
