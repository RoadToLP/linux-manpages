.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Obtains a SID associated with the security context that
has the string representation specified by \fIscontext\fP.
The default SID is passed to the MLS layer to be used to allow
kernel labeling of the MLS field if the MLS field is not present
(for upgrading to MLS without full relabel).
Implicitly forces adding of the context even if it cannot be mapped yet.
Returns -EINVAL if the context is invalid, -ENOMEM if insufficient
memory is available, or 0 on success.
