.SH NAME
nfsd4_decode_bitmap4 \- Decode an NFSv4 bitmap4
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "__be32" nfsd4_decode_bitmap4
.BI "(struct nfsd4_compoundargs *argp "  ","
.BI "u32 *bmval "  ","
.BI "u32 bmlen "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "argp" 12
NFSv4 compound argument structure
.IP "bmval" 12
pointer to an array of u32's to decode into
.IP "bmlen" 12
size of the \fIbmval\fP array
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The server needs to return nfs_ok rather than nfserr_bad_xdr when
encountering bitmaps containing bits it does not recognize. This
includes bits in bitmap words past WORDn, where WORDn is the last
bitmap WORD the implementation currently supports. Thus we are
careful here to simply ignore bits in bitmap words that this
implementation has yet to support explicitly.

Return values:
nfs_ok: \fIbmval\fP populated successfully
nfserr_bad_xdr: the encoded bitmap was invalid
