.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function is the device-level interrupt handler to device with SLI-4
interface spec, called from the PCI layer when either MSI or Pin-IRQ
interrupt mode is enabled and there is an event in the HBA which requires
driver attention. This function invokes the slow-path interrupt attention
handling function and fast-path interrupt attention handling function in
turn to process the relevant HBA attention events. This function is called
without any lock held. It gets the hbalock to access and update SLI data
structures.

This function returns IRQ_HANDLED when interrupt is handled, else it
returns IRQ_NONE.
