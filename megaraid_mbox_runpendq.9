.SH SYNOPSIS

.BI "(adapter_t *adapter "  ","
.BI "scb_t *scb_q "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS

.IP "scb_q" 12
SCB to be queued in the pending list
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Scan the pending list for commands which are not yet issued and try to
post to the controller. The SCB can be a null pointer, which would indicate
no SCB to be queue, just try to execute the ones in the pending list.
.SH "NOTE"
We do not actually traverse the pending list. The SCBs are plucked
out from the head of the pending list. If it is successfully issued, the
next SCB is at the head now.
