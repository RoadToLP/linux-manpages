.SH NAME
ccid2_rtt_estimator \- Sample RTT and compute RTO using RFC2988 algorithm
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" ccid2_rtt_estimator
.BI "(struct sock *sk "  ","
.BI "const long mrtt "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "sk" 12
socket to perform estimator on
.IP "mrtt" 12
-- undescribed --
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This code is almost identical with TCP's \fBtcp_rtt_estimator\fP, since
- it has a higher sampling frequency (recommended by RFC 1323),
- the RTO does not collapse into RTT due to RTTVAR going towards zero,
- it is simple (cf. more complex proposals such as Eifel timer or research
which suggests that the gain should be set according to window size),
- in tests it was found to work well with CCID2 [gerrit].
