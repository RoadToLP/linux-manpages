.BI "(struct device_node *con_np "  ","

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Given a phandle to a supplier device tree node (\fIsup_np\fP), this function
finds the device that owns the supplier device tree node and creates a
device link from \fIdev\fP consumer device to the supplier device. This function
doesn't create device links for invalid scenarios such as trying to create a
link with a parent device as the consumer of its child device. In such
cases, it returns an error.
.SH "RETURN"
- 0 if fwnode link successfully created to supplier
- -EINVAL if the supplier link is invalid and should not be created
- -ENODEV if struct device will never be create for supplier
