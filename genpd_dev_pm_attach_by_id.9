.SH NAME
genpd_dev_pm_attach_by_id \- Associate a device with one of its PM domains.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "struct device *" genpd_dev_pm_attach_by_id
.BI "(struct device *dev "  ","
.BI "unsigned int index "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dev" 12
The device used to lookup the PM domain.
.IP "index" 12
The index of the PM domain.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Parse device's OF node to find a PM domain specifier at the provided \fIindex\fP.
If such is found, creates a virtual device and attaches it to the retrieved
pm_domain ops. To deal with detaching of the virtual device, the ->\fBdetach\fP
callback in the struct dev_pm_domain are assigned to \fBgenpd_dev_pm_detach\fP.

Returns the created virtual device if successfully attached PM domain, NULL
when the device don't need a PM domain, else an \fBERR_PTR\fP in case of
failures. If a power-domain exists for the device, but cannot be found or
turned on, then ERR_PTR(-EPROBE_DEFER) is returned to ensure that the device
is not probed and to re-try again later.
