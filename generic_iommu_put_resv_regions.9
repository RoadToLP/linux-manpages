.B "void" generic_iommu_put_resv_regions
.BI "(struct device *dev "  ","
.BI "struct list_head *list "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dev" 12
device for which to free reserved regions
.IP "list" 12
reserved region list for device
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
IOMMU drivers can use this to implement their .\fBput_resv_regions\fP callback
for simple reservations. Memory allocated for each reserved region will be
freed. If an IOMMU driver allocates additional resources per region, it is
going to have to implement a custom callback.
