.SH NAME
blk_sync_queue \- cancel any pending callbacks on a queue
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" blk_sync_queue
.BI "(struct request_queue *q "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "q" 12
the queue
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The block layer may perform asynchronous callback activity
on a queue, such as calling the unplug function after a timeout.
A block device may call blk_sync_queue to ensure that any
such activity is cancelled, thus allowing it to release resources
that the callbacks might use. The caller must already have made sure
that its ->submit_bio will not re-add plugging prior to calling
this function.

This function does not cancel any asynchronous activity arising
out of elevator or throttling code. That would require \fBelevator_exit\fP
and \fBblkcg_exit_queue\fP to be called with queue lock initialized.
