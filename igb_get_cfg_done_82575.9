pointer to the HW structure

Read the management control register for the config done bit for
completion status.  NOTE: silicon which is EEPROM-less will fail trying
to read the config done bit, so an error is *ONLY* logged and returns
0.  If we were to return with error, EEPROM-less silicon
would not be able to be reset or change link.
