.SH NAME
drm_writeback_queue_job \- Queue a writeback job for later signalling
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" drm_writeback_queue_job
.BI "(struct drm_writeback_connector *wb_connector "  ","
.BI "struct drm_connector_state *conn_state "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "wb_connector" 12
The writeback connector to queue a job on
.IP "conn_state" 12
The connector state containing the job to queue
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function adds the job contained in \fIconn_state\fP to the job_queue for a
writeback connector. It takes ownership of the writeback job and sets the
\fIconn_state->writeback_job\fP to NULL, and so no access to the job may be
performed by the caller after this function returns.

Drivers must ensure that for a given writeback connector, jobs are queued in
exactly the same order as they will be completed by the hardware (and
signaled via drm_writeback_signal_completion).

For every call to \fBdrm_writeback_queue_job\fP there must be exactly one call to
\fBdrm_writeback_signal_completion\fP
