I3C bus to take the lock on
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function takes the bus lock for any operation that is not a maintenance
operation (see \fBi3c_bus_maintenance_lock\fP for a non-exhaustive list of
maintenance operations). Basically all communications with I3C devices are
normal operations (HDR, SDR transfers or CCC commands that do not change bus
state or I3C dynamic address).

Note that this lock is not guaranteeing serialization of normal operations.
In other words, transfer requests passed to the I3C master can be submitted
in parallel and I3C master drivers have to use their own locking to make
sure two different communications are not inter-mixed, or access to the
output/input queue is not done while the engine is busy.
