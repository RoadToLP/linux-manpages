.SH NAME
comedi_pci_detach \- A generic "detach" handler for PCI COMEDI drivers
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" comedi_pci_detach
.BI "(struct comedi_device *dev "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dev" 12
COMEDI device.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
COMEDI drivers for PCI devices that need no special clean-up of private data
and have no ioremapped regions other than that pointed to by \fIdev->mmio\fP may
use this function as its "detach" handler called by the COMEDI core when a
COMEDI device is being detached from the low-level driver.  It may be also
called from a more specific "detach" handler that does additional clean-up.

Free the IRQ if \fIdev->irq\fP is non-zero, iounmap \fIdev->mmio\fP if it is
non-NULL, and call \fBcomedi_pci_disable\fP to release the PCI device's regions
and disable it.
