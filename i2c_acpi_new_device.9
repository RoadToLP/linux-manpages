.SH "DESCRIPTION"
By default the i2c subsys creates an i2c-client for the first I2cSerialBus
resource of an acpi_device, but some acpi_devices have multiple I2cSerialBus
resources, in that case this function can be used to create an i2c-client
for other I2cSerialBus resources in the Current Resource Settings table.

Also see i2c_new_client_device, which this function calls to create the
i2c-client.

Returns a pointer to the new i2c-client, or error pointer in case of failure.
Specifically, -EPROBE_DEFER is returned if the adapter is not found.
