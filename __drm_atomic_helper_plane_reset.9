plane state to assign
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Initializes the newly allocated \fIplane_state\fP and assigns it to
the \fIdrm_crtc->state\fP pointer of \fIplane\fP, usually required when
initializing the drivers or when called from the \fIdrm_plane_funcs.reset\fP
hook.

This is useful for drivers that subclass the plane state.
