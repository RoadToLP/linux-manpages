.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This is the top level queue allocation routine.  The order here is very
important, starting with the "most" number of features turned on at once,
and ending with the smallest set of features.  This way large combinations
can be allocated if they're turned on, and smaller combinations are the
fall through conditions.
