.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function is invoked from the Axi DMA Tx isr to notify the completion
of transmit operation. It clears fields in the corresponding Tx BDs and
unmaps the corresponding buffer so that CPU can regain ownership of the
buffer. It finally invokes "netif_wake_queue" to restart transmission if
required.
