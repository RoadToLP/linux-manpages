.SH "DESCRIPTION"

This routine is invoked to create an nvme localport instance to bind
to the nvme_fc_transport.  It is called once during driver load
like lpfc_create_shost after all other services are initialized.
It requires a vport, vpi, and wwns at call time.  Other localport
parameters are modified as the driver's FCID and the Fabric WWN
are established.

Return codes
0 - successful
-ENOMEM - no heap memory available
other values - from nvme registration upcall
