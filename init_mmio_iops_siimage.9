interface to set up

The basic setup here is fairly simple, we can use standard MMIO
operations. However we do have to set the taskfile register offsets
by hand as there isn't a standard defined layout for them this time.

The hardware supports buffered taskfiles and also some rather nice
extended PRD tables. For better SI3112 support use the libata driver
