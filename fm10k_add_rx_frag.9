fm10k_add_rx_frag \- Add contents of Rx buffer to sk_buff
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "bool" fm10k_add_rx_frag
.BI "(struct fm10k_rx_buffer *rx_buffer "  ","
.BI "unsigned int size "  ","
.BI "union fm10k_rx_desc *rx_desc "  ","
.BI "struct sk_buff *skb "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "rx_buffer" 12
buffer containing page to add
.IP "size" 12
packet size from rx_desc
.IP "rx_desc" 12
descriptor containing length of buffer written by hardware
.IP "skb" 12
sk_buff to place the data into
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function will add the data contained in rx_buffer->page to the skb.
This is done either through a direct copy if the data in the buffer is
less than the skb header size, otherwise it will just attach the page as
a frag to the skb.

The function will then update the page offset if necessary and return
true if the buffer can be reused by the interface.
