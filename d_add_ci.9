.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "struct dentry *" d_add_ci
.BI "(struct dentry *dentry "  ","
.BI "struct inode *inode "  ","
.BI "struct qstr *name "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dentry" 12
the negative dentry that was passed to the parent's lookup func
.IP "inode" 12
the inode case-insensitive lookup has found
.IP "name" 12
the case-exact name to be associated with the returned dentry
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This is to avoid filling the dcache with case-insensitive names to the
same inode, only the actual correct case is stored in the dcache for
case-insensitive filesystems.

For a case-insensitive lookup match and if the case-exact dentry
already exists in the dcache, use it and return it.

If no entry exists with the exact case name, allocate new dentry with
the exact case, and return the spliced entry.
