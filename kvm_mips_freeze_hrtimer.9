.SH NAME
kvm_mips_freeze_hrtimer \- Safely stop the hrtimer.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "ktime_t" kvm_mips_freeze_hrtimer
.BI "(struct kvm_vcpu *vcpu "  ","
.BI "u32 *count "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "vcpu" 12
Virtual CPU.
.IP "count" 12
Output pointer for CP0_Count value at point of freeze.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Freeze the hrtimer safely and return both the ktime and the CP0_Count value
at the point it was frozen. It is guaranteed that any pending interrupts at
the point it was frozen are handled, and none after that point.

This is useful where the time/CP0_Count is needed in the calculation of the
new parameters.

Assumes !kvm_mips_count_disabled(\fIvcpu\fP) (guest CP0_Count timer is running).
.SH "RETURN"
The ktime at the point of freeze.
