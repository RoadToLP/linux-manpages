default attributes for the root device
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
All 'system' subsystems have a /sys/devices/system/<name> root device
with the name of the subsystem. The root device can carry subsystem-
wide attributes. All registered devices are below this single root
device and are named after the subsystem with a simple enumeration
number appended. The registered devices are not explicitly named;
only 'id' in the device needs to be set.

Do not use this interface for anything new, it exists for compatibility
with bad ideas only. New subsystems should use plain subsystems; and
add the subsystem-wide attributes should be added to the subsystem
directory itself and not some create fake root-device placed in
/sys/devices/system/<name>.
