.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Useful to test detection and handling of automated re-transmits by the EC.
Specifically of packets that the EC considers not-ACKed but the driver
already considers ACKed (due to dropped ACK). In this case, the EC
re-transmits the packet-to-be-ACKed and the driver should detect it as
duplicate/already handled. Note that the driver should still send an ACK
for the re-transmitted packet.
