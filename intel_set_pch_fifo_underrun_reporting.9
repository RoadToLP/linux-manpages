intel_set_pch_fifo_underrun_reporting \- set PCH fifo underrun reporting state
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "bool" intel_set_pch_fifo_underrun_reporting
.BI "(struct drm_i915_private *dev_priv "  ","
.BI "enum pipe pch_transcoder "  ","
.BI "bool enable "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dev_priv" 12
i915 device instance
.IP "pch_transcoder" 12
the PCH transcoder (same as pipe on IVB and older)
.IP "enable" 12
whether underruns should be reported or not
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function makes us disable or enable PCH fifo underruns for a specific
PCH transcoder. Notice that on some PCHs (e.g. CPT/PPT), disabling FIFO
underrun reporting for one transcoder may also disable all the other PCH
error interruts for the other transcoders, due to the fact that there's just
one interrupt mask/enable bit for all the transcoders.

Returns the previous state of underrun reporting.
