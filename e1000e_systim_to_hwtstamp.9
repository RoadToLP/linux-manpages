.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "adapter" 12
board private structure
.IP "hwtstamps" 12
time stamp structure to update
.IP "systim" 12
unsigned 64bit system time value.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Convert the system time value stored in the RX/TXSTMP registers into a
hwtstamp which can be used by the upper level time stamping functions.

The 'systim_lock' spinlock is used to protect the consistency of the
system time value. This is needed because reading the 64 bit time
value involves reading two 32 bit registers. The first read latches the
value.
