.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The \fImode\fP parameter specifies if the volume should be opened in read-only
mode, read-write mode, or exclusive mode. The exclusive mode guarantees that
nobody else will be able to open this volume. UBI allows to have many volume
readers and one writer at a time.

If a static volume is being opened for the first time since boot, it will be
checked by this function, which means it will be fully read and the CRC
checksum of each logical eraseblock will be checked.

This function returns volume descriptor in case of success and a negative
error code in case of failure.
