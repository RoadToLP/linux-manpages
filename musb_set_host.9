musb controller driver data
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
At least some musb revisions need to enable devctl session bit in
peripheral mode to switch to host mode. Initializes things to host
mode and sets A_IDLE. SoC glue needs to advance state further
based on phy provided VBUS state.

Note that the SoC glue code may need to wait for musb to settle
on enable before calling this to avoid babble.
