.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This is a generic form of the CXL mailbox send command thus only using the
registers defined by the mailbox capability ID - CXL 2.0 8.2.8.4. Memory
devices, and perhaps other types of CXL devices may have further information
available upon error conditions. Driver facilities wishing to send mailbox
commands should use the wrapper command.

The CXL spec allows for up to two mailboxes. The intention is for the primary
mailbox to be OS controlled and the secondary mailbox to be used by system
firmware. This allows the OS and firmware to communicate with the device and
not need to coordinate with each other. The driver only uses the primary
mailbox.
