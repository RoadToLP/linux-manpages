.SH NAME
fsverity_file_open \- prepare to open a verity file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" fsverity_file_open
.BI "(struct inode *inode "  ","
.BI "struct file *filp "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "inode" 12
the inode being opened
.IP "filp" 12
the struct file being set up
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
When opening a verity file, deny the open if it is for writing.  Otherwise,
set up the inode's ->i_verity_info if not already done.

When combined with fscrypt, this must be called after \fBfscrypt_file_open\fP.
Otherwise, we won't have the key set up to decrypt the verity metadata.
.SH "RETURN"
0 on success, -errno on failure
