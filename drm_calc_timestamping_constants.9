.SH NAME
drm_calc_timestamping_constants \- calculate vblank timestamp constants
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" drm_calc_timestamping_constants
.BI "(struct drm_crtc *crtc "  ","
.BI "const struct drm_display_mode *mode "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "crtc" 12
drm_crtc whose timestamp constants should be updated.
.IP "mode" 12
display mode containing the scanout timings
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Calculate and store various constants which are later needed by vblank and
swap-completion timestamping, e.g, by
\fBdrm_crtc_vblank_helper_get_vblank_timestamp\fP. They are derived from
CRTC's true scanout timing, so they take things like panel scaling or
other adjustments into account.
