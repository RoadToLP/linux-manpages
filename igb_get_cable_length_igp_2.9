The automatic gain control (agc) normalizes the amplitude of the
received signal, adjusting for the attenuation produced by the
cable.  By reading the AGC registers, which represent the
combination of coarse and fine gain value, the value can be put
into a lookup table to obtain the approximate cable length
for each channel.
