protocol family to remove

This function is called by a protocol handler that wants to
remove its address family, and have it unlinked from the
new socket creation.

If protocol handler is a module, then it can use module reference
counts to protect against new references. If protocol handler is not
a module then it needs to provide its own protection in
the ops->create routine.
