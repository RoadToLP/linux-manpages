synth_event_create \- Create a new synthetic event
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" synth_event_create
.BI "(const char *name "  ","
.BI "struct synth_field_desc *fields "  ","
.BI "unsigned int n_fields "  ","
.BI "struct module *mod "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "name" 12
The name of the new synthetic event
.IP "fields" 12
An array of type/name field descriptions
.IP "n_fields" 12
The number of field descriptions contained in the fields array
.IP "mod" 12
The module creating the event, NULL if not created from a module
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Create a new synthetic event with the given name under the
trace/events/synthetic/ directory.  The event fields that will be
defined for the event should be passed in as an array of struct
synth_field_desc, and the number elements in the array passed in as
n_fields. Field ordering will retain the ordering given in the
fields array.

If the new synthetic event is being created from a module, the mod
param must be non-NULL.  This will ensure that the trace buffer
won't contain unreadable events.

The new synth event should be deleted using \fBsynth_event_delete\fP
function.  The new synthetic event can be generated from modules or
other kernel code using \fBtrace_synth_event\fP and related functions.
.SH "RETURN"
0 if successful, error otherwise.
