.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" seq_put_hex_ll
.BI "(struct seq_file *m "  ","
.BI "const char *delimiter "  ","
.BI "unsigned long long v "  ","
.BI "unsigned int width "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "m" 12
seq_file identifying the buffer to which data should be written
.IP "delimiter" 12
a string which is printed before the number
.IP "v" 12

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
seq_put_hex_ll(m, "", v, 8) is equal to seq_printf(m, "08llx", v)

This routine is very quick when you show lots of numbers.
In usual cases, it will be better to use \fBseq_printf\fP. It's easier to read.
