.SH NAME
sof_ipc_probe_dma_info \- retrieve list of active injection dmas
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" sof_ipc_probe_dma_info
.BI "(struct snd_sof_dev *sdev "  ","
.BI "struct sof_probe_dma **dma "  ","
.BI "size_t *num_dma "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "sdev" 12
SOF sound device
.IP "dma" 12
Returned list of active dmas
.IP "num_dma" 12
Returned count of active dmas
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Host sends DMA_INFO request to obtain list of injection dmas it
can use to transfer data over with.

Note that list contains only injection dmas as there is only one
extractor (dma) and it is always assigned on probing init.
DSP knows exactly where data from extraction probes is going to,
which is not the case for injection where multiple streams
could be engaged.
