.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function scans the MDIO bus, looking for devices which can be
identified using a vendor/product ID in registers 2 and 3. Not all
MDIO devices have such registers, but PHY devices typically
do. Hence this function assumes anything found is a PHY, or can be
treated as a PHY. Other MDIO devices, such as switches, will
probably not be found during the scan.
