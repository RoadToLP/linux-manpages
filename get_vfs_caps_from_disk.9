.BI "(struct user_namespace *mnt_userns "  ","
.BI "const struct dentry *dentry "  ","

.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "mnt_userns" 12
user namespace of the mount the inode was found from
.IP "dentry" 12
dentry from which \fIinode\fP is retrieved
.IP "cpu_caps" 12
vfs capabilities
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Extract the on-exec-apply capability sets for an executable file.

If the inode has been found through an idmapped mount the user namespace of
the vfsmount must be passed through \fImnt_userns\fP. This function will then
take care to map the inode according to \fImnt_userns\fP before checking
permissions. On non-idmapped mounts or if permission checking is to be
performed on the raw inode simply passs init_user_ns.
