.SH NAME
pm_runtime_get_if_active \- Conditionally bump up device usage counter.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" pm_runtime_get_if_active
.BI "(struct device *dev "  ","
.BI "bool ign_usage_count "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dev" 12
Device to handle.
.IP "ign_usage_count" 12
Whether or not to look at the current usage counter value.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Return -EINVAL if runtime PM is disabled for \fIdev\fP.

Otherwise, if the runtime PM status of \fIdev\fP is RPM_ACTIVE and either
\fIign_usage_count\fP is true or the runtime PM usage counter of \fIdev\fP is not
zero, increment the usage counter of \fIdev\fP and return 1. Otherwise, return 0
without changing the usage counter.

If \fIign_usage_count\fP is true, this function can be used to prevent suspending
the device when its runtime PM status is RPM_ACTIVE.

If \fIign_usage_count\fP is false, this function can be used to prevent
suspending the device when both its runtime PM status is RPM_ACTIVE and its
runtime PM usage counter is not zero.

The caller is responsible for decrementing the runtime PM usage counter of
\fIdev\fP after this function has returned a positive value for it.
