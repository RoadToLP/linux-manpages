.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" bfq_active_insert
.BI "(struct bfq_service_tree *st "  ","
.BI "struct bfq_entity *entity "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "st" 12
the service tree of the entity.
.IP "entity" 12
the entity being inserted.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The active tree is ordered by finish time, but an extra key is kept
per each node, containing the minimum value for the start times of
its children (and the node itself), so it's possible to search for
the eligible node with the lowest finish time in logarithmic time.
