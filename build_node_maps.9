.SH NAME
build_node_maps \- callback to setup mem_data structs for each node
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" build_node_maps
.BI "(unsigned long start "  ","
.BI "unsigned long len "  ","
.BI "int node "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "start" 12
physical start of range
.IP "len" 12
length of range
.IP "node" 12
node where this range resides
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Detect extents of each piece of memory that we wish to
treat as a virtually contiguous block (i.e. each node). Each such block
must start on an IA64_GRANULE_SIZE boundary, so we round the address down
if necessary.  Any non-existent pages will simply be part of the virtual
memmap.
