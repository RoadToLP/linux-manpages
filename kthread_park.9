.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" kthread_park

.SH ARGUMENTS

thread created by \fBkthread_create\fP.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Sets \fBkthread_should_park\fP for \fIk\fP to return true, wakes it, and
waits for it to return. This can also be called after \fBkthread_create\fP
instead of calling \fBwake_up_process\fP: the thread will park without
calling \fBthreadfn\fP.

Returns 0 if the thread is parked, -ENOSYS if the thread exited.
If called by the kthread itself just the park bit is set.
