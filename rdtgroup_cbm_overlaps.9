.SH NAME
rdtgroup_cbm_overlaps \- Does CBM overlap with other use of hardware
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "bool" rdtgroup_cbm_overlaps
.BI "(struct rdt_resource *r "  ","
.BI "struct rdt_domain *d "  ","
.BI "unsigned long cbm "  ","
.BI "int closid "  ","
.BI "bool exclusive "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "r" 12
Resource to which domain instance \fId\fP belongs.
.IP "d" 12
The domain instance for which \fIclosid\fP is being tested.
.IP "cbm" 12
Capacity bitmask being tested.
.IP "closid" 12
Intended closid for \fIcbm\fP.
.IP "exclusive" 12
Only check if overlaps with exclusive resource groups
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Resources that can be allocated using a CBM can use the CBM to control
the overlap of these allocations. \fBrdtgroup_cmb_overlaps\fP is the test
for overlap. Overlap test is not limited to the specific resource for
which the CBM is intended though - when dealing with CDP resources that
share the underlying hardware the overlap check should be performed on
the CDP resource sharing the hardware also.

Refer to description of \fB__rdtgroup_cbm_overlaps\fP for the details of the
overlap test.
.SH "RETURN"
true if CBM overlap detected, false if there is no overlap
