.BI "struct slave *slave "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "bond" 12
bonding we're working on
.IP "slave" 12
the slave that was just detached
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
We assume that \fIslave\fP was already detached from the slave list.

If \fIslave\fP's permanent hw address is different both from its current
address and from \fIbond\fP's address, then somewhere in the bond there's
a slave that has \fIslave\fP's permanet address as its current address.
We'll make sure that that slave no longer uses \fIslave\fP's permanent address.

Caller must hold RTNL and no other locks
