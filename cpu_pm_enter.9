.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Notifies listeners that a single CPU is entering a low power state that may
cause some blocks in the same power domain as the cpu to reset.

Must be called on the affected CPU with interrupts disabled.  Platform is
responsible for ensuring that cpu_pm_enter is not called twice on the same
CPU before cpu_pm_exit is called. Notified drivers can include VFP
co-processor, interrupt controller and its PM extensions, local CPU
timers context save/restore which shouldn't be interrupted. Hence it
must be called with interrupts disabled.

Return conditions are same as __raw_notifier_call_chain.
