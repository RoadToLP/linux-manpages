.SH NAME
scsi_get_vpd_page \- Get Vital Product Data from a SCSI device
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" scsi_get_vpd_page
.BI "(struct scsi_device *sdev "  ","
.BI "u8 page "  ","
.BI "unsigned char *buf "  ","
.BI "int buf_len "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "sdev" 12
The device to ask
.IP "page" 12
Which Vital Product Data to return
.IP "buf" 12
where to store the VPD
.IP "buf_len" 12
number of bytes in the VPD buffer area
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
SCSI devices may optionally supply Vital Product Data.  Each 'page'
of VPD is defined in the appropriate SCSI document (eg SPC, SBC).
If the device supports this VPD page, this routine returns a pointer
to a buffer containing the data from that page.  The caller is
responsible for calling \fBkfree\fP on this pointer when it is no longer
needed.  If we cannot retrieve the VPD page this routine returns NULL.
