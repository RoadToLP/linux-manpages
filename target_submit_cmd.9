pointer to SCSI sense buffer
.IP "unpacked_lun" 12
unpacked LUN to reference for struct se_lun
.IP "data_length" 12
fabric expected data transfer length

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Task tags are supported if the caller has set \fIse_cmd->tag\fP.

Returns non zero to signal active I/O shutdown failure.  All other
setup exceptions will be returned as a SCSI CHECK_CONDITION response,
but still return zero here.

This may only be called from process context, and also currently
assumes internal allocation of fabric payload buffer by target-core.

It also assumes interal target core SGL memory allocation.
