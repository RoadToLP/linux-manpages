.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function ensures that there is no data on the flash at the index and
LPT head locations.

This deals with the recovery of a half-completed journal commit. UBIFS is
careful never to overwrite the last version of the index or the LPT. Because
the index and LPT are wandering trees, data from a half-completed commit will
not be referenced anywhere in UBIFS. The data will be either in LEBs that are
assumed to be empty and will be unmapped anyway before use, or in the index
and LPT heads.

This function returns 0 on success and a negative error code on failure.
