.SH NAME
ldm_validate_partition_table \- Determine whether bdev might be a dynamic disk
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "bool" ldm_validate_partition_table
.BI "(struct parsed_partitions *state "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "state" 12
Partition check state including device holding the LDM Database
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function provides a weak test to decide whether the device is a dynamic
disk or not.  It looks for an MS-DOS-style partition table containing at
least one partition of type 0x42 (formerly SFS, now used by Windows for
dynamic disks).

N.B.  The only possible error can come from the read_part_sector and that is
only likely to happen if the underlying device is strange.  If that IS
the case we should return zero to let someone else try.
.SH "RETURN"
'true'   \fIstate->bdev\fP is a dynamic disk
'false'  \fIstate->bdev\fP is not a dynamic disk, or an error occurred
