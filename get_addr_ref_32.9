.BI "struct pt_regs *regs "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "insn" 12
Instruction with ModRM, SIB bytes and displacement
.IP "regs" 12
Register values as seen when entering kernel mode
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function is to be used with 32-bit address encodings to obtain the
linear memory address referred by the instruction's ModRM, SIB,
displacement bytes and segment base address, as applicable. If in protected
mode, segment limits are enforced.
