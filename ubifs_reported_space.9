ubifs_reported_space \- calculate reported free space.

.B "long long" ubifs_reported_space
.BI "(const struct ubifs_info *c "  ","
.BI "long long free "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "c" 12
the UBIFS file-system description object
.IP "free" 12
amount of free space
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function calculates amount of free space which will be reported to
user-space. User-space application tend to expect that if the file-system
(e.g., via the '\fBstatfs\fP' call) reports that it has N bytes available, they
are able to write a file of size N. UBIFS attaches node headers to each data
node and it has to write indexing nodes as well. This introduces additional
overhead, and UBIFS has to report slightly less free space to meet the above
expectations.

This function assumes free space is made up of uncompressed data nodes and
full index nodes (one per data node, tripled because we always allow enough
space to write the index thrice).

Note, the calculation is pessimistic, which means that most of the time
UBIFS reports less space than it actually has.
