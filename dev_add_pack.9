packet type declaration

Add a protocol handler to the networking stack. The passed \fIpacket_type\fP
is linked into kernel lists and may not be freed until it has been
removed from the kernel lists.

This call does not sleep therefore it can not
guarantee all CPU's that are in middle of receiving packets
will see the new packet type (until the next received packet).
