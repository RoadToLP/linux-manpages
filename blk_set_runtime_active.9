.SH NAME
blk_set_runtime_active \- Force runtime status of the queue to be active
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" blk_set_runtime_active
.BI "(struct request_queue *q "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "q" 12
the queue of the device
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
If the device is left runtime suspended during system suspend the resume
hook typically resumes the device and corrects runtime status
accordingly. However, that does not affect the queue runtime PM status
which is still "suspended". This prevents processing requests from the
queue.

This function can be used in driver's resume hook to correct queue
runtime PM status and re-enable peeking requests from the queue. It
should be called before first request is added to the queue.

This function is also called by \fBblk_post_runtime_resume\fP for successful
runtime resumes.  It does everything necessary to restart the queue.
