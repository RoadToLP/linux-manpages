.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Remove a PCI device from the device lists, informing the drivers
that the device has been removed.  We also remove any subordinate
buses and children in a depth-first manner.

For each device we remove, delete the device structure from the
device lists, remove the /proc entry, and notify userspace
(/sbin/hotplug).
