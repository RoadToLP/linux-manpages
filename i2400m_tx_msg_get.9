i2400m_tx_msg_get \- Get the first TX message in the FIFO to start sending it

.BI "size_t *bus_size "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS

where to place the size of the TX message
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Called by the bus-specific driver to get the first TX message at
the FIF that is ready for transmission.

It sets the state in \fIi2400m\fP to indicate the bus-specific driver is
transferring that message (i2400m->tx_msg_size).

Once the transfer is completed, call \fBi2400m_tx_msg_sent\fP.
.SH "NOTES"

The size of the TX message to be transmitted might be smaller than
that of the TX message in the FIFO (in case the header was
shorter). Hence, we copy it in \fIbus_size\fP, for the bus layer to
use. We keep the message's size in i2400m->tx_msg_size so that
when the bus later is done transferring we know how much to
advance the fifo.

We collect statistics here as all the data is available and we
assume it is going to work [see \fBi2400m_tx_msg_sent\fP].
