.SH NAME
fscrypt_match_name \- test whether the given name matches a directory entry
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "bool" fscrypt_match_name
.BI "(const struct fscrypt_name *fname "  ","
.BI "const u8 *de_name "  ","
.BI "u32 de_name_len "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "fname" 12
the name being searched for
.IP "de_name" 12
the name from the directory entry
.IP "de_name_len" 12
the length of \fIde_name\fP in bytes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Normally \fIfname->disk_name\fP will be set, and in that case we simply compare
that to the name stored in the directory entry.  The only exception is that
if we don't have the key for an encrypted directory and the name we're
looking for is very long, then we won't have the full disk_name and instead
we'll need to match against a fscrypt_nokey_name that includes a strong hash.
.SH "RETURN"
true if the name matches, otherwise false.
