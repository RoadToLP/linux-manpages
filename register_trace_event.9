.SH NAME
register_trace_event \- register output for an event type
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" register_trace_event
.BI "(struct trace_event *event "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "event" 12
the event type to register
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Event types are stored in a hash and this hash is used to
find a way to print an event. If the \fIevent->type\fP is set
then it will use that type, otherwise it will assign a
type to use.

If you assign your own type, please make sure it is added
to the trace_type enum in trace.h, to avoid collisions
with the dynamic types.

Returns the event type number or zero on error.
