.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Based on the error code given in \fIerror\fP, send an ICMP error message back to
the originating host.  From the IETF draft ...

"If the contents of the CIPSO [option] are valid but the security label is
outside of the configured host or port label range, the datagram is
discarded and an ICMP 'destination unreachable' (type 3) is generated and
returned.  The code field of the ICMP is set to 'communication with
destination network administratively prohibited' (code 9) or to
'communication with destination host administratively prohibited'
(code 10).  The value of the code is dependent on whether the originator
of the ICMP message is acting as a CIPSO host or a CIPSO gateway.  The
recipient of the ICMP message MUST be able to handle either value.  The
same procedure is performed if a CIPSO [option] can not be added to an
IP packet because it is too large to fit in the IP options area."

"If the error is triggered by receipt of an ICMP message, the message is
discarded and no response is permitted (consistent with general ICMP
processing rules)."
