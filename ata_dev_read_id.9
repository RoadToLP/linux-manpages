Read ID data from the specified device.  ATA_CMD_ID_ATA is
performed on ATA devices and ATA_CMD_ID_ATAPI on ATAPI
devices.  This function also issues ATA_CMD_INIT_DEV_PARAMS
for pre-ATA4 drives.

FIXME: ATA_CMD_ID_ATA is optional for early drives and right
now we abort if we hit that case.

LOCKING:
Kernel thread context (may sleep)
.SH "RETURN"
0 on success, -errno otherwise.
