.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "unsigned int" comedi_buf_write_samples
.BI "(struct comedi_subdevice *s "  ","
.BI "const void *data "  ","
.BI "unsigned int nsamples "  ");"

COMEDI subdevice.
.IP "data" 12
Pointer to source samples.
.IP "nsamples" 12
Number of samples to write.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Write up to \fInsamples\fP samples to the COMEDI acquisition data buffer
associated with the subdevice, mark it as written and update the
acquisition scan progress.  If there is not enough room for the specified
number of samples, the number of samples written is limited to the number
that will fit and the COMEDI_CB_OVERFLOW event flag is set to cause the
acquisition to terminate with an overrun error.  Set the COMEDI_CB_BLOCK
event flag if any samples are written to cause waiting tasks to be woken
when the event flags are processed.
.SH "RETURN"
The amount of data written in bytes.
