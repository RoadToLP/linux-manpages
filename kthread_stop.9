.SH NAME
kthread_stop \- stop a thread created by kthread_create().
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" kthread_stop
.BI "(struct task_struct *k "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "k" 12
thread created by \fBkthread_create\fP.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Sets \fBkthread_should_stop\fP for \fIk\fP to return true, wakes it, and
waits for it to exit. This can also be called after \fBkthread_create\fP
instead of calling \fBwake_up_process\fP: the thread will exit without
calling \fBthreadfn\fP.

If \fBthreadfn\fP may call \fBdo_exit\fP itself, the caller must ensure
task_struct can't go away.

Returns the result of \fBthreadfn\fP, or -EINTR if \fBwake_up_process\fP
was never called.
