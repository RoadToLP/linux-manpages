.SH "DESCRIPTION"
If no country IE has been received always enable passive scan
and no-ibss on these channels. This is only done for specific
regulatory SKUs.

If a country IE has been received check its rule for this
channel first before enabling active scan. The passive scan
would have been enforced by the initial processing of our
custom regulatory domain.
