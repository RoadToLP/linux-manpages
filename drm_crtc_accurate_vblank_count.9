which counter to retrieve
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function is similar to \fBdrm_crtc_vblank_count\fP but this function
interpolates to handle a race with vblank interrupts using the high precision
timestamping support.

This is mostly useful for hardware that can obtain the scanout position, but
doesn't have a hardware frame counter.
