.SH "DESCRIPTION"
HChaCha is the ChaCha equivalent of HSalsa and is an intermediate step
towards XChaCha (see https://cr.yp.to/snuffle/xsalsa-20081128.pdf).  HChaCha
skips the final addition of the initial state, and outputs only certain words
of the state.  It should not be used for streaming directly.
