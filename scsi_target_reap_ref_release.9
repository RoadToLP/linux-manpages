.SH ARGUMENTS

the reap_ref in the target being released
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Called on last put of reap_ref, which is the indication that no device
under this target is visible anymore, so render the target invisible in
sysfs.  Note: we have to be in user context here because the target reaps
should be done in places where the scsi device visibility is being removed.
