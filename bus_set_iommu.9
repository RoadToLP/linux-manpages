.SH NAME
bus_set_iommu \- set iommu-callbacks for the bus
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" bus_set_iommu
.BI "(struct bus_type *bus "  ","
.BI "const struct iommu_ops *ops "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "bus" 12
bus.
.IP "ops" 12
the callbacks provided by the iommu-driver
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function is called by an iommu driver to set the iommu methods
used for a particular bus. Drivers for devices on that bus can use
the iommu-api after these ops are registered.
This special function is needed because IOMMUs are usually devices on
the bus itself, so the iommu drivers are not initialized when the bus
is set up. With this function the iommu-driver can set the iommu-ops
afterwards.
