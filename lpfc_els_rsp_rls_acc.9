.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This routine is the completion callback function for the MBX_READ_LNK_STAT
mailbox command. This callback function is to actually send the Accept
(ACC) response to a Read Port Status (RPS) unsolicited IOCB event. It
collects the link statistics from the completion of the MBX_READ_LNK_STAT
mailbox command, constructs the RPS response with the link statistics
collected, and then invokes the \fBlpfc_sli_issue_iocb\fP routine to send ACC
response to the RPS.

Note that, in \fBlpfc_prep_els_iocb\fP routine, the reference count of ndlp
will be incremented by 1 for holding the ndlp and the reference to ndlp
will be stored into the context1 field of the IOCB for the completion
callback function to the RPS Accept Response ELS IOCB command.
