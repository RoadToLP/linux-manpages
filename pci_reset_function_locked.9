PCI device to reset
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Some devices allow an individual function to be reset without affecting
other functions in the same device.  The PCI device must be responsive
to PCI config space in order to use this function.

This function does not just reset the PCI portion of a device, but
clears all the state associated with the device.  This function differs
from \fB__pci_reset_function_locked\fP in that it saves and restores device state
over the reset.  It also differs from \fBpci_reset_function\fP in that it
requires the PCI device lock to be held.

Returns 0 if the device function was successfully reset or negative if the
device doesn't support resetting a single function.
