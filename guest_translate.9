.IP "asce" 12
effective asce
.IP "mode" 12

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Translate a guest virtual address into a guest absolute address by means
of dynamic address translation as specified by the architecture.
If the resulting absolute address is not available in the configuration
an addressing exception is indicated and \fIgpa\fP will not be changed.
.SH "RETURN"
- zero on success; \fIgpa\fP contains the resulting absolute address
- a negative value if guest access failed due to e.g. broken
guest mapping
- a positve value if an access exception happened. In this case
the returned value is the program interruption code as defined
by the architecture
