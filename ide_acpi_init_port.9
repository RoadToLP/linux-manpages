.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The ACPI spec is not quite clear when the drive identify buffer
should be obtained. Calling IDENTIFY DEVICE during shutdown
is not the best of ideas as the drive might already being put to
sleep. And obviously we can't call it during resume.
So we get the information during startup; but this means that
any changes during run-time will be lost after resume.
