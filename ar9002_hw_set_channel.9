.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This is the function to change channel on single-chip devices, that is
all devices after ar9280.

This function takes the channel value in MHz and sets
hardware channel value. Assumes writes have been enabled to analog bus.

Actual Expression,

For 2GHz channel,
Channel Frequency = (3/4) * freq_ref * (chansel[8:0] + chanfrac[16:0]/2^17)
(freq_ref = 40MHz)

For 5GHz channel,
Channel Frequency = (3/2) * freq_ref * (chansel[8:0] + chanfrac[16:0]/2^10)
(freq_ref = 40MHz/(24>>amodeRefSel))
