.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "adapter" 12
board private structure to initialize

This function initializes the vf specific data storage and then attempts to
allocate the VFs.  The reason for ordering it this way is because it is much
mor expensive time wise to disable SR-IOV than it is to allocate and free
the memory for the VFs.
