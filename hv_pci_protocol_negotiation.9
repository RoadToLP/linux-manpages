.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "hdev" 12
VMBus's tracking struct for this root PCI bus.
.IP "version" 12
Array of supported channel protocol versions in
the order of probing - highest go first.
.IP "num_version" 12
Number of elements in the version array.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This driver is intended to support running on Windows 10
(server) and later versions. It will not run on earlier
versions, as they assume that many of the operations which
Linux needs accomplished with a spinlock held were done via
asynchronous messaging via VMBus.  Windows 10 increases the
surface area of PCI emulation so that these actions can take
place by suspending a virtual processor for their duration.

This function negotiates the channel protocol version,
failing if the host doesn't support the necessary protocol
level.
