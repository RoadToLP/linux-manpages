.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Used to synchronize the update of pm_idle function pointer. It's
called after the pointer is updated and returns after the dummy
callback function has been executed on all cpus. The execution of
the function can only happen on the remote cpus after they have
left the idle function which had been called via pm_idle function
pointer. So it's guaranteed that nothing uses the previous pointer
anymore.
