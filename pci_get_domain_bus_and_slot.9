.SH NAME
pci_get_domain_bus_and_slot \- locate PCI device for a given PCI domain (segment), bus, and slot
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "struct pci_dev *" pci_get_domain_bus_and_slot
.BI "(int domain "  ","
.BI "unsigned int bus "  ","
.BI "unsigned int devfn "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "domain" 12
PCI domain/segment on which the PCI device resides.
.IP "bus" 12
PCI bus on which desired PCI device resides
.IP "devfn" 12
encodes number of PCI slot in which the desired PCI device
resides and the logical device number within that slot in case of
multi-function devices.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Given a PCI domain, bus, and slot/function number, the desired PCI
device is located in the list of PCI devices. If the device is
found, its reference count is increased and this function returns a
pointer to its data structure.  The caller must decrement the
reference count by calling \fBpci_dev_put\fP.  If no device is found,
NULL is returned.
