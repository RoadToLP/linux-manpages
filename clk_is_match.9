.SH NAME
clk_is_match \- check if two clk's point to the same hardware clock
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "bool" clk_is_match
.BI "(const struct clk *p "  ","
.BI "const struct clk *q "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "p" 12
clk compared against q
.IP "q" 12
clk compared against p
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Returns true if the two struct clk pointers both point to the same hardware
clock node. Put differently, returns true if struct clk *p and struct clk *q
share the same struct clk_core object.

Returns false otherwise. Note that two NULL clks are treated as matching.
