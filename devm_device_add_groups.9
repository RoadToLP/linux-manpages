This function creates a bunch of managed attribute groups.  If an error
occurs when creating a group, all previously created groups will be
removed, unwinding everything back to the original state when this
function was called.  It will explicitly warn and error if any of the
attribute files being created already exist.

Returns 0 on success or error code from sysfs_create_group on failure.
