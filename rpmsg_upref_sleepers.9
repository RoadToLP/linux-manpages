.SH NAME
rpmsg_upref_sleepers \- enable "tx-complete" interrupts, if needed
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" rpmsg_upref_sleepers
.BI "(struct virtproc_info *vrp "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "vrp" 12
virtual remote processor state
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function is called before a sender is blocked, waiting for
a tx buffer to become available.

If we already have blocking senders, this function merely increases
the "sleepers" reference count, and exits.

Otherwise, if this is the first sender to block, we also enable
virtio's tx callbacks, so we'd be immediately notified when a tx
buffer is consumed (we rely on virtio's tx callback in order
to wake up sleeping senders as soon as a tx buffer is used by the
remote processor).
