.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "struct drm_file *" drm_file_alloc
.BI "(struct drm_minor *minor "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS

minor to allocate on
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This allocates a new DRM file context. It is not linked into any context and
can be used by the caller freely. Note that the context keeps a pointer to
\fIminor\fP, so it must be freed before \fIminor\fP is.
.SH "RETURN"
Pointer to newly allocated context, ERR_PTR on failure.
