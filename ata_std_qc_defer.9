ATA command in question

Non-NCQ commands cannot run with any other command, NCQ or
not.  As upper layer only knows the queue depth, we are
responsible for maintaining exclusion.  This function checks
whether a new command \fIqc\fP can be issued.

LOCKING:
spin_lock_irqsave(host lock)
.SH "RETURN"
ATA_DEFER_* if deferring is needed, 0 otherwise.
