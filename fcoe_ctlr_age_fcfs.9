An FCF is considered old if we have missed two advertisements.
That is, there have been no valid advertisement from it for 2.5
times its keep-alive period.

In addition, determine the time when an FCF selection can occur.

Also, increment the MissDiscAdvCount when no advertisement is received
for the corresponding FCF for 1.5 * FKA_ADV_PERIOD (FC-BB-5 LESB).

Returns the time in jiffies for the next call.
