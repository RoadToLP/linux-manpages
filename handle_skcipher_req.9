.B "int" handle_skcipher_req
.BI "(struct iproc_reqctx_s *rctx "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS

Crypto request context
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This may be called on the crypto API thread, or, when a request is so large
it must be broken into multiple SPU messages, on the thread used to invoke
the response callback. When requests are broken into multiple SPU
messages, we assume subsequent messages depend on previous results, and
thus always wait for previous results before submitting the next message.
Because requests are submitted in lock step like this, there is no need
to synchronize access to request data structures.
.SH "RETURN"
-EINPROGRESS: request has been accepted and result will be returned
asynchronously
Any other value indicates an error
