.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Calculate and return the number of bytes required to hold an itcw with the
given parameters and assuming tccbs with maximum size.

Note that the resulting size also contains bytes needed for alignment
padding as well as padding to ensure that data structures don't cross a
4k-boundary where required.
