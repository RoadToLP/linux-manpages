.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "class" 12
search for a PCI device with this class designation
.IP "from" 12
Previous PCI device found in search, or NULL for new search.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Iterates through the list of known PCI devices.  If a PCI device is
found with a matching \fIclass\fP, the reference count to the device is
incremented and a pointer to its device structure is returned.
Otherwise, NULL is returned.
A new search is initiated by passing NULL as the \fIfrom\fP argument.
Otherwise if \fIfrom\fP is not NULL, searches continue from next device
on the global list.  The reference count for \fIfrom\fP is always decremented
if it is not NULL.
