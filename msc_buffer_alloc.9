.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Allocate a storage buffer for MSC, depending on the msc::mode, it will be
either done via \fBmsc_buffer_contig_alloc\fP for SINGLE operation mode or
\fBmsc_buffer_win_alloc\fP for multiblock operation. The latter allocates one
window per invocation, so in multiblock mode this can be called multiple
times for the same MSC to allocate multiple windows.

This modifies msc::win_list and msc::base, which requires msc::buf_mutex
to serialize, so the caller is expected to hold it.
.SH "RETURN"
0 on success, -errno otherwise.
