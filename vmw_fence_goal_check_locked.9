.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function should be called with the fence manager lock held.
It is typically called when an action has been attached to a fence to
check whether the seqno of that fence should be used for a fence
goal interrupt. This is typically needed if the current fence goal is
invalid, or has a higher seqno than that of the current fence object.

returns true if the device goal seqno was updated. False otherwise.
