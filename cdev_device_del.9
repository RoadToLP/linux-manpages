.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBcdev_device_del\fP is a helper function to call cdev_del and device_del.
It should be used whenever cdev_device_add is used.

If dev->devt is not set it will not remove the cdev and will be equivalent
to device_del.
.SH "NOTE"
This guarantees that associated sysfs callbacks are not running
or runnable, however any cdevs already open will remain and their fops
will still be callable even after this function returns.
