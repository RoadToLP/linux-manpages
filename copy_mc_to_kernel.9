.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Call into the 'fragile' version on systems that benefit from avoiding
corner case poison consumption scenarios, For example, accessing
poison across 2 cachelines with a single instruction. Almost all
other uses case can use \fBcopy_mc_enhanced_fast_string\fP for a fast
recoverable copy, or fallback to plain memcpy.

Return 0 for success, or number of bytes not copied if there was an
exception.
