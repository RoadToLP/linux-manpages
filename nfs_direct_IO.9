.SH NAME
nfs_direct_IO \- NFS address space operation for direct I/O
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "ssize_t" nfs_direct_IO
.BI "(struct kiocb *iocb "  ","
.BI "struct iov_iter *iter "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "iocb" 12
target I/O control block
.IP "iter" 12
I/O buffer
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The presence of this routine in the address space ops vector means
the NFS client supports direct I/O. However, for most direct IO, we
shunt off direct read and write requests before the VFS gets them,
so this method is only ever called for swap.
