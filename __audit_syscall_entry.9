.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Fill in audit context at syscall entry.  This only happens if the
audit context was created when the task was created and the state or
filters demand the audit context be built.  If the state from the
per-task filter or from the per-syscall filter is AUDIT_RECORD_CONTEXT,
then the record will be written at syscall exit time (otherwise, it
will only be written if another part of the kernel requests that it
be written).
