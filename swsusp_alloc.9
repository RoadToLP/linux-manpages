.SH "DESCRIPTION"

We first try to allocate as many highmem pages as there are
saveable highmem pages in the system.  If that fails, we allocate
non-highmem pages for the copies of the remaining highmem ones.

In this approach it is likely that the copies of highmem pages will
also be located in the high memory, because of the way in which
\fBcopy_data_pages\fP works.
