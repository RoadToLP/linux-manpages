.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function is used by the "small" LPT model to cause the entire LEB
properties tree to be written.  The "small" LPT model does not use LPT
garbage collection because it is more efficient to write the entire tree
(because it is small).

This function returns 0 on success and a negative error code on failure.
