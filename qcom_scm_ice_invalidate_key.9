.SH NAME
qcom_scm_ice_invalidate_key \- Invalidate an inline encryption key
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" qcom_scm_ice_invalidate_key
.BI "(u32 index "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "index" 12
the keyslot to invalidate
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The UFSHCI and eMMC standards define a standard way to do this, but it
doesn't work on these SoCs; only this SCM call does.

It is assumed that the SoC has only one ICE instance being used, as this SCM
call doesn't specify which ICE instance the keyslot belongs to.
.SH "RETURN"
0 on success; -errno on failure.
