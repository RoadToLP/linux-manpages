.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Shows if the global trace has been enabled or not. It uses the
mirror flag "buffer_disabled" to be used in fast paths such as for
the irqsoff tracer. But it may be inaccurate due to races. If you
need to know the accurate state, use \fBtracing_is_on\fP which is a little
slower, but accurate.
