.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function configures both the local side (host) and the peer side
(device) unipro attributes to establish the connection to application/
cport.
This function is not required if the hardware is properly configured to
have this connection setup on reset. But invoking this function does no
harm and should be fine even working with any ufs device.

Returns 0 on success non-zero value on failure
