struct powerdomain * to read the state for
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Reads the previous logic powerstate for a powerdomain. This
function must determine the previous logic powerstate by first
checking the previous powerstate for the domain. If that was OFF,
then logic has been lost. If previous state was RETENTION, the
function reads the setting for the next retention logic state to
see the actual value.  In every other case, the logic is
retained. Returns either PWRDM_POWER_OFF or PWRDM_POWER_RET
depending whether the logic was retained or not.
