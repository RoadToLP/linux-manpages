.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Unbinds the context \fIctx\fP from the SPU \fIspu\fP. If \fIfree_spu\fP is non-zero, the
SPU is made available for other contexts (ie, may be returned by
spu_get_idle). If this is zero, the caller is expected to schedule another
context to this spu.

Should be called with ctx->state_mutex held.
