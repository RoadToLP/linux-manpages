.SH NAME
cxlflash_mmap_fault \- mmap fault handler for adapter file descriptor
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "vm_fault_t" cxlflash_mmap_fault
.BI "(struct vm_fault *vmf "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "vmf" 12
VM fault associated with current fault.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
To support error notification via MMIO, faults are 'caught' by this routine
that was inserted before passing back the adapter file descriptor on attach.
When a fault occurs, this routine evaluates if error recovery is active and
if so, installs the error page to 'notify' the user about the error state.
During normal operation, the fault is simply handled by the original fault
handler that was installed by CXL services as part of initializing the
adapter file descriptor. The VMA's page protection bits are toggled to
indicate cached/not-cached depending on the memory backing the fault.
.SH "RETURN"
0 on success, VM_FAULT_SIGBUS on failure
