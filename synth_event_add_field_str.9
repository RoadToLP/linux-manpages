.IP "cmd" 12
A pointer to the dynevent_cmd struct representing the new event
.IP "type_name" 12
The type and name of the new field to add, as a single string
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Add a new field to a synthetic event cmd object, as a single
string.  The \fItype_name\fP string is expected to be of the form 'type
name', which will be appended by ';'.  No sanity checking is done -
what's passed in is assumed to already be well-formed.  Field
ordering is in the same order the fields are added.

See \fBsynth_field_size\fP for available types. If field_name contains
[n] the field is considered to be an array.
.SH "RETURN"
0 if successful, error otherwise.
