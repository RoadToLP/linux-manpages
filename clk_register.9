.SH "DESCRIPTION"
clk_register is the *deprecated* interface for populating the clock tree with
new clock nodes. Use \fBclk_hw_register\fP instead.
.SH "RETURN"
a pointer to the newly allocated struct clk which
cannot be dereferenced by driver code but may be used in conjunction with the
rest of the clock API.  In the event of an error clk_register will return an
error code; drivers must test for an error code after calling clk_register.
