packet offload declaration

Remove a protocol offload handler that was previously added to the
kernel offload handlers by \fBdev_add_offload\fP. The passed \fIoffload_type\fP
is removed from the kernel lists and can be freed or reused once this
function returns.

The packet type might still be in use by receivers
and must not be freed until after all the CPU's have gone
through a quiescent state.
