.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Test to see if the SDIO interrupt is being signalled in case the
controller has failed to re-detect a card interrupt. Read GPE8 and
see if it is low and if so, signal a SDIO interrupt.

This is currently called if a request is finished (we assume that the
bus is now idle) and when the SDIO IRQ is enabled in case the IRQ is
already being indicated.
