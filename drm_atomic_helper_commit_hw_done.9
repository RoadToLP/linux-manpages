.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function is used to signal completion of the hardware commit step. After
this step the driver is not allowed to read or change any permanent software
or hardware modeset state. The only exception is state protected by other
means than \fIdrm_modeset_lock\fP locks.

Drivers should try to postpone any expensive or delayed cleanup work after
this function is called.

This is part of the atomic helper support for nonblocking commits, see
\fBdrm_atomic_helper_setup_commit\fP for an overview.
