.SH NAME
comedi_alloc_subdev_readback \- Allocate memory for the subdevice readback
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" comedi_alloc_subdev_readback
.BI "(struct comedi_subdevice *s "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "s" 12
COMEDI subdevice.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This is called by low-level COMEDI drivers to allocate an array to record
the last values written to a subdevice's analog output channels (at least
by the INSN_WRITE instruction), to allow them to be read back by an
INSN_READ instruction.  It also provides a default handler for the
INSN_READ instruction unless one has already been set.

On success, \fIs->readback\fP points to the first element of the array, which
is zero-filled.  The low-level driver is responsible for updating its
contents.  \fIs->insn_read\fP will be set to \fBcomedi_readback_insn_read\fP
unless it is already non-NULL.

Returns 0 on success, -EINVAL if the subdevice has no channels, or
-ENOMEM on allocation failure.
