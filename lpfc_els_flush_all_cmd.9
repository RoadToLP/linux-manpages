.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This routine is used to clean up all the outstanding ELS commands on a
\fIphba\fP. It first aborts the \fIphba\fP by invoking the \fBlpfc_fabric_abort_hba\fP
routine. After that, it walks the ELS transmit queue to remove all the
IOCBs to the \fIphba\fP other than the QUE_RING and ABORT/CLOSE IOCBs. For
the IOCBs with the completion callback function associated, the callback
function will be invoked with the status set to IOSTAT_LOCAL_REJECT and
un.ulpWord[4] set to IOERR_SLI_ABORTED. For IOCBs without the completion
callback function associated, the IOCB will simply be released. Finally,
it walks the ELS transmit completion queue to issue an abort IOCB to any
transmit completion queue IOCB that is not an IOCB from libdfc (i.e., the
management plane IOCBs that are not part of the discovery state machine)
out to HBA by invoking the \fBlpfc_sli_issue_abort_iotag\fP routine.
