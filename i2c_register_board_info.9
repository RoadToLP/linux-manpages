.SH NAME
i2c_register_board_info \- statically declare I2C devices
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" i2c_register_board_info
.BI "(int busnum "  ","
.BI "struct i2c_board_info const *info "  ","
.BI "unsigned len "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "busnum" 12
identifies the bus to which these devices belong
.IP "info" 12
vector of i2c device descriptors
.IP "len" 12
how many descriptors in the vector; may be zero to reserve
the specified bus number.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Systems using the Linux I2C driver stack can declare tables of board info
while they initialize.  This should be done in board-specific init code
near \fBarch_initcall\fP time, or equivalent, before any I2C adapter driver is
registered.  For example, mainboard init code could define several devices,
as could the init code for each daughtercard in a board stack.

The I2C devices will be created later, after the adapter for the relevant
bus has been registered.  After that moment, standard driver model tools
are used to bind "new style" I2C drivers to the devices.  The bus number
for any device declared using this routine is not available for dynamic
allocation.

The board info passed can safely be __initdata, but be careful of embedded
pointers (for platform_data, functions, etc) since that won't be copied.
Device properties are deep-copied though.
