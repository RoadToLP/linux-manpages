.SH "DESCRIPTION"
If a LEB has only dirty and free space, then we may safely unmap it and make
it free.  Note, we cannot do this with indexing LEBs because dirty space may
correspond index nodes that are required for recovery.  In that case, the
LEB cannot be unmapped until after the next commit.

This function returns 0 upon success and a negative error code upon failure.
