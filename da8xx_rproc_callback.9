.SH "DESCRIPTION"

This handler is invoked directly by the kernel whenever the remote
core (DSP) has modified the state of a virtqueue.  There is no
"payload" message indicating the virtqueue index as is the case with
mailbox-based implementations on OMAP4.  As such, this handler "polls"
each known virtqueue index for every invocation.
