.SH NAME
relay_late_setup_files \- triggers file creation
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" relay_late_setup_files
.BI "(struct rchan *chan "  ","
.BI "const char *base_filename "  ","
.BI "struct dentry *parent "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "chan" 12
channel to operate on
.IP "base_filename" 12
base name of files to create
.IP "parent" 12
dentry of parent directory, NULL for root directory

Returns 0 if successful, non-zero otherwise.

Use to setup files for a previously buffer-only channel created
by \fBrelay_open\fP with a NULL parent dentry.

For example, this is useful for perfomring early tracing in kernel,
before VFS is up and then exposing the early results once the dentry
is available.
