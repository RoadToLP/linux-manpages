.SH NAME
cpuidle_coupled_set_not_ready \- mark a cpu as not ready
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" cpuidle_coupled_set_not_ready
.BI "(struct cpuidle_coupled *coupled "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "coupled" 12
the struct coupled that contains the current cpu
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Decrements the ready counter, unless the ready (and thus the waiting) counter
is equal to the number of online cpus.  Prevents a race where one cpu
decrements the waiting counter and then re-increments it just before another
cpu has decremented its ready counter, leading to the ready counter going
down from the number of online cpus without going through the coupled idle
state.

Returns 0 if the counter was decremented successfully, -EINVAL if the ready
counter was equal to the number of online cpus.
