.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Enables a low level driver to set a hard upper limit,
max_hw_sectors, on the size of requests.  max_hw_sectors is set by
the device driver based upon the capabilities of the I/O
controller.

max_dev_sectors is a hard limit imposed by the storage device for
READ/WRITE requests. It is set by the disk driver.

max_sectors is a soft limit imposed by the block layer for
filesystem type requests.  This value can be overridden on a
per-device basis in /sys/block/<device>/queue/max_sectors_kb.
The soft limit can not exceed max_hw_sectors.
