nommu_shrink_inode_mappings \- Shrink the shared mappings on an inode
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" nommu_shrink_inode_mappings
.BI "(struct inode *inode "  ","
.BI "size_t size "  ","
.BI "size_t newsize "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "inode" 12
The inode to check
.IP "size" 12
The current filesize of the inode
.IP "newsize" 12
The proposed filesize of the inode
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Check the shared mappings on an inode on behalf of a shrinking truncate to
make sure that any outstanding VMAs aren't broken and then shrink the
vm_regions that extend beyond so that \fBdo_mmap\fP doesn't
automatically grant mappings that are too large.
