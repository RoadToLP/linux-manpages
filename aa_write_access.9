permissions or data.

For permissions queries, ubuf must begin with "label\0", followed by the
profile query specific format described in the \fBquery_label\fP function
documentation.

For data queries, ubuf must have the form "data\0<LABEL>\0<KEY>\0", where
<LABEL> is the name of the security confinement context and <KEY> is the
name of the data to retrieve.
