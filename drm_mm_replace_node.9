.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "old" 12
drm_mm_node to remove from the allocator
.IP "new" 12
drm_mm_node which should inherit \fIold\fP's allocation

This is useful for when drivers embed the drm_mm_node structure and hence
can't move allocations by reassigning pointers. It's a combination of remove
and insert with the guarantee that the allocation start will match.
