.SH NAME
xas_nomem \- Allocate memory if needed.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "bool" xas_nomem
.BI "(struct xa_state *xas "  ","
.BI "gfp_t gfp "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "xas" 12
XArray operation state.
.IP "gfp" 12
Memory allocation flags.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
If we need to add new nodes to the XArray, we try to allocate memory
with GFP_NOWAIT while holding the lock, which will usually succeed.
If it fails, \fIxas\fP is flagged as needing memory to continue.  The caller
should drop the lock and call \fBxas_nomem\fP.  If \fBxas_nomem\fP succeeds,
the caller should retry the operation.

Forward progress is guaranteed as one node is allocated here and
stored in the xa_state where it will be found by \fBxas_alloc\fP.  More
nodes will likely be found in the slab allocator, but we do not tie
them up here.
.SH "RETURN"
true if memory was needed, and was successfully allocated.
