.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Use this function to enable backlight handling if your panel
uses device tree and has a backlight phandle.

When the panel is enabled backlight will be enabled after a
successful call to \fIdrm_panel_funcs\fP.\fBenable\fP

When the panel is disabled backlight will be disabled before the
call to \fIdrm_panel_funcs\fP.\fBdisable\fP.

A typical implementation for a panel driver supporting device tree
will call this function at probe time. Backlight will then be handled
transparently without requiring any intervention from the driver.
\fBdrm_panel_of_backlight\fP must be called after the call to \fBdrm_panel_init\fP.
.SH "RETURN"
0 on success or a negative error code on failure.
