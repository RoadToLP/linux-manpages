the host to regulate
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Returns 0 or errno. errno should be handled, it is either a critical error
or -EPROBE_DEFER. 0 means no critical error but it does not mean all
regulators have been found because they all are optional. If you require
certain regulators, you need to check separately in your driver if they got
populated after calling this function.
