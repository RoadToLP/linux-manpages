.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Pick up a fixup entry matching with the given model string or SSID.
If a fixup was already set beforehand, the function doesn't do anything.
When a special model string "nofixup" is given, also no fixup is applied.

The function tries to find the matching model name at first, if given.
If nothing matched, try to look up the PCI SSID.
If still nothing matched, try to look up the codec SSID.
