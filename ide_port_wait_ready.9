This is needed on some PPCs and a bunch of BIOS-less embedded
platforms.  Typical cases are:

- The firmware hard reset the disk before booting the kernel,
the drive is still doing it's poweron-reset sequence, that
can take up to 30 seconds.

- The firmware does nothing (or no firmware), the device is
still in POST state (same as above actually).

- Some CD/DVD/Writer combo drives tend to drive the bus during
their reset sequence even when they are non-selected slave
devices, thus preventing discovery of the main HD.

Doing this wait-for-non-busy should not harm any existing
configuration and fix some issues like the above.
