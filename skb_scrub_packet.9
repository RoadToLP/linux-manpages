.SH "DESCRIPTION"
skb_scrub_packet can be used after encapsulating or decapsulting a packet
into/from a tunnel. Some information have to be cleared during these
operations.
skb_scrub_packet can also be used to clean a skb before injecting it in
another namespace (\fIxnet\fP == true). We have to clear all information in the
skb that could impact namespace isolation.
