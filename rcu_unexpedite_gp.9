Undo a prior call to \fBrcu_expedite_gp\fP.  If all prior calls to
\fBrcu_expedite_gp\fP are undone by a subsequent call to \fBrcu_unexpedite_gp\fP,
and if the rcu_expedited sysfs/boot parameter is not set, then all
subsequent calls to \fBsynchronize_rcu\fP and friends will return to
their normal non-expedited behavior.
