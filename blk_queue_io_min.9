.SH NAME
blk_queue_io_min \- set minimum request size for the queue
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" blk_queue_io_min
.BI "(struct request_queue *q "  ","
.BI "unsigned int min "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "q" 12
the request queue for the device
.IP "min" 12
smallest I/O size in bytes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Storage devices may report a granularity or preferred minimum I/O
size which is the smallest request the device can perform without
incurring a performance penalty.  For disk drives this is often the
physical block size.  For RAID arrays it is often the stripe chunk
size.  A properly aligned multiple of minimum_io_size is the
preferred request size for workloads where a high number of I/O
operations is desired.
