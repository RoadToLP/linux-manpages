.SH "DESCRIPTION"
IMPORTANT: When the ucast_shared flag is set to false and m_list has
multiple unicast addresses, the function assumes that all the
addresses are unique in a given add_mac call. It doesn't
check for duplicates in this case, removing duplicates from a given
list should be taken care of in the caller of this function.
