.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function executes a full reset procedure on a PE, including setting
the appropriate flags, performing a fundamental or hot reset, and then
deactivating the reset status.  It is designed to be used within the EEH
subsystem, as opposed to eeh_pe_reset which is exported to drivers and
only performs a single operation at a time.

This function will attempt to reset a PE three times before failing.
