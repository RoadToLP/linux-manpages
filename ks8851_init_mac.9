.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Get or create the initial mac address for the device and then set that
into the station address register. A mac address supplied in the device
tree takes precedence. Otherwise, if there is an EEPROM present, then
we try that. If no valid mac address is found we use \fBeth_random_addr\fP
to create a new one.
