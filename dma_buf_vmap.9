.SH NAME
dma_buf_vmap \- Create virtual mapping for the buffer object into kernel address space. Same restrictions as for vmap and friends apply.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" dma_buf_vmap
.BI "(struct dma_buf *dmabuf "  ","
.BI "struct dma_buf_map *map "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dmabuf" 12
[in]    buffer to vmap
.IP "map" 12
[out]   returns the vmap pointer
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This call may fail due to lack of virtual mapping address space.
These calls are optional in drivers. The intended use for them
is for mapping objects linear in kernel space for high use objects.

To ensure coherency users must call \fBdma_buf_begin_cpu_access\fP and
\fBdma_buf_end_cpu_access\fP around any cpu access performed through this
mapping.

Returns 0 on success, or a negative errno code otherwise.
