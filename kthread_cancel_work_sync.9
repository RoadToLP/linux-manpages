.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "bool" kthread_cancel_work_sync
.BI "(struct kthread_work *work "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "work" 12
the kthread work to cancel
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Cancel \fIwork\fP and wait for its execution to finish.  This function
can be used even if the work re-queues itself. On return from this
function, \fIwork\fP is guaranteed to be not pending or executing on any CPU.

kthread_cancel_work_sync(\fIdelayed_work->work\fP) must not be used for
delayed_work's. Use \fBkthread_cancel_delayed_work_sync\fP instead.

The caller must ensure that the worker on which \fIwork\fP was last
queued can't be destroyed before this function returns.
.SH "RETURN"
true if \fIwork\fP was pending, false otherwise.
