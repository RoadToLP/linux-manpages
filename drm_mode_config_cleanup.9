DRM device
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Free up all the connectors and CRTCs associated with this DRM device, then
free up the framebuffers and associated buffer objects.

Note that since this /should/ happen single-threaded at driver/device
teardown time, no locking is required. It's the driver's job to ensure that
this guarantee actually holds true.

FIXME: With the managed \fBdrmm_mode_config_init\fP it is no longer necessary for
drivers to explicitly call this function.
