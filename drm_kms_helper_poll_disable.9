.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function disables the output polling work.

Drivers can call this helper from their device suspend implementation. It is
not an error to call this even when output polling isn't enabled or already
disabled. Polling is re-enabled by calling \fBdrm_kms_helper_poll_enable\fP.

Note that calls to enable and disable polling must be strictly ordered, which
is automatically the case when they're only call from suspend/resume
callbacks.
