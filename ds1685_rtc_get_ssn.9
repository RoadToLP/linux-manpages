.SH NAME
ds1685_rtc_get_ssn \- retrieve the silicon serial number.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" ds1685_rtc_get_ssn
.BI "(struct ds1685_priv *rtc "  ","
.BI "u8 *ssn "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "rtc" 12
pointer to the ds1685 rtc structure.
.IP "ssn" 12
u8 array to hold the bits of the silicon serial number.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This number starts at 0x40, and is 8-bytes long, ending at 0x47. The
first byte is the model number, the next six bytes are the serial number
digits, and the final byte is a CRC check byte.  Together, they form the
silicon serial number.

These values are stored in bank1, so ds1685_rtc_switch_to_bank1 must be
called first before calling this function, else data will be read out of
the bank0 NVRAM.  Be sure to call ds1685_rtc_switch_to_bank0 when done.
