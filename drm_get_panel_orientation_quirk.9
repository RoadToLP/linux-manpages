.SH NAME
drm_get_panel_orientation_quirk \- Check for panel orientation quirks
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" drm_get_panel_orientation_quirk
.BI "(int width "  ","
.BI "int height "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "width" 12
width in pixels of the panel
.IP "height" 12
height in pixels of the panel
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function checks for platform specific (e.g. DMI based) quirks
providing info on panel_orientation for systems where this cannot be
probed from the hard-/firm-ware. To avoid false-positive this function
takes the panel resolution as argument and checks that against the
resolution expected by the quirk-table entry.

Note this function is also used outside of the drm-subsys, by for example
the efifb code. Because of this this function gets compiled into its own
kernel-module when built as a module.
.SH "RETURN"
A DRM_MODE_PANEL_ORIENTATION_* value if there is a quirk for this system,
or DRM_MODE_PANEL_ORIENTATION_UNKNOWN if there is no quirk.
