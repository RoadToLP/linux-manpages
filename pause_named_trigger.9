.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "data" 12
The trigger data of a named trigger to pause

Pauses a named trigger along with all other triggers having the
same name.  Because named triggers share a common set of data,
pausing only one is meaningless, so pausing one named trigger needs
to pause all triggers with the same name.
