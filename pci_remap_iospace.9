.BI "phys_addr_t phys_addr "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "res" 12
Resource describing the I/O space
.IP "phys_addr" 12
physical address of range to be mapped
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Remap the memory mapped I/O space described by the \fIres\fP and the CPU
physical address \fIphys_addr\fP into virtual address space.  Only
architectures that have memory mapped IO functions defined (and the
