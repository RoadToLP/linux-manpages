.SH NAME
throtl_pending_timer_fn \- timer function for service_queue->pending_timer
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" throtl_pending_timer_fn
.BI "(struct timer_list *t "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "t" 12
the pending_timer member of the throtl_service_queue being serviced
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This timer is armed when a child throtl_grp with active bio's become
pending and queued on the service_queue's pending_tree and expires when
the first child throtl_grp should be dispatched.  This function
dispatches bio's from the children throtl_grps to the parent
service_queue.

If the parent's parent is another throtl_grp, dispatching is propagated
by either arming its pending_timer or repeating dispatch directly.  If
the top-level service_tree is reached, throtl_data->dispatch_work is
kicked so that the ready bio's are issued.
