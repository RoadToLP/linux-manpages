.SH NAME
r4k_op_needs_ipi \- Decide if a cache op needs to be done on every core.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "bool" r4k_op_needs_ipi
.BI "(unsigned int type "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "type" 12
Type of cache operations (R4K_HIT or R4K_INDEX).
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Decides whether a cache op needs to be performed on every core in the system.
This may change depending on the \fItype\fP of cache operation, as well as the set
of online CPUs, so preemption should be disabled by the caller to prevent CPU
hotplug from changing the result.
.SH "RETURN"
1 if the cache operation \fItype\fP should be done on every core in
the system.
0 if the cache operation \fItype\fP is globalized and only needs to
be performed on a simple CPU.
