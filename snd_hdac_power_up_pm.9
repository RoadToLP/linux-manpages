.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function can be called in a recursive code path like init code
which may be called by PM suspend/resume again.  OTOH, if a power-up
call must wake up the sleeper (e.g. in a kctl callback), use
\fBsnd_hdac_power_up\fP instead.

Returns zero if successful, or a negative error code.
