drm_dev_get \- Take reference of a DRM device
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" drm_dev_get
.BI "(struct drm_device *dev "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dev" 12
device to take reference of or NULL
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This increases the ref-count of \fIdev\fP by one. You *must* already own a
reference when calling this. Use \fBdrm_dev_put\fP to drop this reference
again.

This function never fails. However, this function does not provide *any*
guarantee whether the device is alive or running. It only provides a
reference to the object and the memory associated with it.
