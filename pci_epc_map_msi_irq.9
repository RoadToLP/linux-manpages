.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "epc" 12
the EPC device which has the MSI capability
.IP "func_no" 12
the physical endpoint function number in the EPC device
.IP "phys_addr" 12
the physical address of the outbound region
.IP "interrupt_num" 12
the MSI interrupt number
.IP "entry_size" 12
Size of Outbound address region for each interrupt
.IP "msi_data" 12
the data that should be written in order to raise MSI interrupt
with interrupt number as 'interrupt num'
.IP "msi_addr_offset" 12
Offset of MSI address from the aligned outbound address
to which the MSI address is mapped
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Invoke to map physical address to MSI address and return MSI data. The
physical address should be an address in the outbound region. This is
required to implement doorbell functionality of NTB wherein EPC on either
side of the interface (primary and secondary) can directly write to the
physical address (in outbound region) of the other interface to ring
doorbell.
