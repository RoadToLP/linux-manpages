.SH NAME
e1000_get_cfg_done_ich8lan \- Read config done bit after Full or PHY reset
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "s32" e1000_get_cfg_done_ich8lan
.BI "(struct e1000_hw *hw "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "hw" 12
pointer to the HW structure

Read appropriate register for the config done bit for completion status
and configure the PHY through s/w for EEPROM-less parts.
.SH "NOTE"
some silicon which is EEPROM-less will fail trying to read the
config done bit, so only an error is logged and continues.  If we were
to return with error, EEPROM-less silicon would not be able to be reset
or change link.
