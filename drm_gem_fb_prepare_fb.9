.SH NAME
drm_gem_fb_prepare_fb \- Prepare a GEM backed framebuffer
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" drm_gem_fb_prepare_fb
.BI "(struct drm_plane *plane "  ","
.BI "struct drm_plane_state *state "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "plane" 12
Plane
.IP "state" 12
Plane state the fence will be attached to
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function extracts the exclusive fence from \fIdrm_gem_object.resv\fP and
attaches it to plane state for the atomic helper to wait on. This is
necessary to correctly implement implicit synchronization for any buffers
shared as a struct \fIdma_buf\fP. This function can be used as the
\fIdrm_plane_helper_funcs.prepare_fb\fP callback.

There is no need for \fIdrm_plane_helper_funcs.cleanup_fb\fP hook for simple
gem based framebuffer drivers which have their buffers always pinned in
memory.

See \fBdrm_atomic_set_fence_for_plane\fP for a discussion of implicit and
explicit fencing in atomic modeset updates.
