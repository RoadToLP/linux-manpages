.SH NAME
drm_crtc_from_index \- find the registered CRTC at an index
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "struct drm_crtc *" drm_crtc_from_index
.BI "(struct drm_device *dev "  ","
.BI "int idx "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dev" 12
DRM device
.IP "idx" 12
index of registered CRTC to find for
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Given a CRTC index, return the registered CRTC from DRM device's
list of CRTCs with matching index. This is the inverse of \fBdrm_crtc_index\fP.
It's useful in the vblank callbacks (like \fIdrm_driver.enable_vblank\fP or
\fIdrm_driver.disable_vblank\fP), since that still deals with indices instead
of pointers to \fIstruct drm_crtc\fP."
