Callback to update driver data on the frozen disk
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Helper function for low-level device drivers to (re) allocate and initialize
a disk request queue zone bitmaps. This functions should normally be called
within the disk ->revalidate method for blk-mq based drivers.  For BIO based
drivers only q->nr_zones needs to be updated so that the sysfs exposed value
is correct.
If the \fIupdate_driver_data\fP callback function is not NULL, the callback is
executed with the device request queue frozen after all zones have been
checked.
