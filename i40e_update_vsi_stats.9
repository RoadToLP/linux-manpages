.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" i40e_update_vsi_stats
.BI "(struct i40e_vsi *vsi "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS

the VSI to be updated
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
There are a few instances where we store the same stat in a
couple of different structs.  This is partly because we have
the netdev stats that need to be filled out, which is slightly
different from the "eth_stats" defined by the chip and used in
VF communications.  We sort it out here.
