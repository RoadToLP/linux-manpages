.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Release a syncpoint previously allocated using \fBhost1x_syncpt_request\fP. A
host1x client driver should call this when the syncpoint is no longer in
use. Note that client drivers must ensure that the syncpoint doesn't remain
under the control of hardware after calling this function, otherwise two
clients may end up trying to access the same syncpoint concurrently.
