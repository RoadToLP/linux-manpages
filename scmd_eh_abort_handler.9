command to be aborted.
.SH "NOTE"
this function must be called only for a command that has timed out.
Because the block layer marks a request as complete before it calls
\fBscsi_times_out\fP, a .\fBscsi_done\fP call from the LLD for a command that has
timed out do not have any effect. Hence it is safe to call
\fBscsi_finish_command\fP from this function.
