.SH NAME
sis96x_get_mac_addr \- Get MAC address for SiS962 or SiS963 model
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" sis96x_get_mac_addr
.BI "(struct pci_dev *pci_dev "  ","
.BI "struct net_device *net_dev "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "pci_dev" 12
the sis900 pci device
.IP "net_dev" 12
the net device to get address for

SiS962 or SiS963 model, use EEPROM to store MAC address. And EEPROM
is shared by
LAN and 1394. When accessing EEPROM, send EEREQ signal to hardware first
and wait for EEGNT. If EEGNT is ON, EEPROM is permitted to be accessed
by LAN, otherwise it is not. After MAC address is read from EEPROM, send
EEDONE signal to refuse EEPROM access by LAN.
The EEPROM map of SiS962 or SiS963 is different to SiS900.
The signature field in SiS962 or SiS963 spec is meaningless.
MAC address is read into \fInet_dev->dev_addr\fP.
