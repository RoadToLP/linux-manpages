.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "phba" 12
pointer to lpfc hba data structure.
.IP "pmb" 12
pointer to the driver internal queue element for mailbox command.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The configure port mailbox command is used to identify the Port Control
Block (PCB) in the driver memory. After this command is issued, the
driver must not access the mailbox in the HBA without first resetting
the HBA. The HBA may copy the PCB information to internal storage for
subsequent use; the driver can not change the PCB information unless it
resets the HBA.

This routine prepares the mailbox command for configuring port.
