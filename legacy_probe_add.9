Controller specific info

Add an entry into the probe list for ATA controllers. This is used
to add the default ISA slots and then to build up the table
further according to other ISA/VLB/Weird device scans

An I/O port list is used to keep ordering stable and sane, as we
don't have any good way to talk about ordering otherwise
