.B "int" take_gc_lnum

.SH ARGUMENTS

UBIFS file-system description object
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function ensures that the LEB reserved for garbage collection is marked
as "taken" in lprops. We also have to set free space to LEB size and dirty
space to zero, because lprops may contain out-of-date information if the
file-system was un-mounted before it has been committed. This function
returns zero in case of success and a negative error code in case of
failure.
