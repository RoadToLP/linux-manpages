.SH "DESCRIPTION"
After this function is called, the IDR is empty, and may be reused or
the data structure containing it may be freed.

A typical clean-up sequence for objects stored in an idr tree will use
\fBidr_for_each\fP to free all objects, if necessary, then \fBidr_destroy\fP to
free the memory used to keep track of those objects.
