.SH NAME
tty_ldisc_ref_wait \- wait for the tty ldisc
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "struct tty_ldisc *" tty_ldisc_ref_wait
.BI "(struct tty_struct *tty "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "tty" 12
tty device

Dereference the line discipline for the terminal and take a
reference to it. If the line discipline is in flux then
wait patiently until it changes.
.SH "RETURN"
NULL if the tty has been hungup and not re-opened with
a new file descriptor, otherwise valid ldisc reference

Note 1: Must not be called from an IRQ/timer context. The caller
must also be careful not to hold other locks that will deadlock
against a discipline change, such as an existing ldisc reference
(which we check for)

Note 2: a file_operations routine (read/poll/write) should use this
function to wait for any ldisc lifetime events to finish.
