.SH NAME
ice_calc_vf_first_vector_idx \- Calculate MSIX vector index in the PF space
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" ice_calc_vf_first_vector_idx
.BI "(struct ice_pf *pf "  ","
.BI "struct ice_vf *vf "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "pf" 12
pointer to PF structure
.IP "vf" 12
pointer to VF that the first MSIX vector index is being calculated for
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This returns the first MSIX vector index in PF space that is used by this VF.
This index is used when accessing PF relative registers such as
GLINT_VECT2FUNC and GLINT_DYN_CTL.
This will always be the OICR index in the AVF driver so any functionality
using vf->first_vector_idx for queue configuration will have to increment by
1 to avoid meddling with the OICR index.
