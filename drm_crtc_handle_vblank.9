.SH NAME
drm_crtc_handle_vblank \- handle a vblank event
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "bool" drm_crtc_handle_vblank
.BI "(struct drm_crtc *crtc "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "crtc" 12
where this event occurred
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Drivers should call this routine in their vblank interrupt handlers to
update the vblank counter and send any signals that may be pending.

This is the native KMS version of \fBdrm_handle_vblank\fP.

Note that for a given vblank counter value \fBdrm_crtc_handle_vblank\fP
and \fBdrm_crtc_vblank_count\fP or \fBdrm_crtc_vblank_count_and_time\fP
provide a barrier: Any writes done before calling
\fBdrm_crtc_handle_vblank\fP will be visible to callers of the later
functions, iff the vblank count is the same or a later one.

See also \fIdrm_vblank_crtc.count\fP.
.SH "RETURN"
True if the event was successfully handled, false on failure.
