This routine is invoked to enable device interrupt and associate driver's
interrupt handler(s) to interrupt vector(s) to device with SLI-3 interface
spec. Depends on the interrupt mode configured to the driver, the driver
will try to fallback from the configured interrupt mode to an interrupt
mode which is supported by the platform, kernel, and device in the order
of:
MSI-X -> MSI -> IRQ.
