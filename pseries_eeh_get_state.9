.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Retrieve the state of the specified PE. On RTAS compliant
pseries platform, there already has one dedicated RTAS function
for the purpose. It's notable that the associated PE config address
might be ready when calling the function. Therefore, endeavour to
use the PE config address if possible. Further more, there're 2
RTAS calls for the purpose, we need to try the new one and back
to the old one if the new one couldn't work properly.
