cyclecounter structure
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function reads SYSTIME registers. It is called by the cyclecounter
structure to convert from internal representation into nanoseconds. We need
this for X550 since some skews do not have expected clock frequency and
result of SYSTIME is 32bits of "billions of cycles" and 32 bits of
"cycles", rather than seconds and nanoseconds.
