.SH NAME
lpfc_cmpl_els_flogi \- Completion callback function for flogi
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" lpfc_cmpl_els_flogi
.BI "(struct lpfc_hba *phba "  ","
.BI "struct lpfc_iocbq *cmdiocb "  ","
.BI "struct lpfc_iocbq *rspiocb "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "phba" 12
pointer to lpfc hba data structure.
.IP "cmdiocb" 12
pointer to lpfc command iocb data structure.
.IP "rspiocb" 12
pointer to lpfc response iocb data structure.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This routine is the top-level completion callback function for issuing
a Fabric Login (FLOGI) command. If the response IOCB reported error,
the \fBlpfc_els_retry\fP routine shall be invoked to retry the FLOGI. If
retry has been made (either immediately or delayed with \fBlpfc_els_retry\fP
returning 1), the command IOCB will be released and function returned.
If the retry attempt has been given up (possibly reach the maximum
number of retries), one additional decrement of ndlp reference shall be
invoked before going out after releasing the command IOCB. This will
actually release the remote node (Note, \fBlpfc_els_free_iocb\fP will also
invoke one decrement of ndlp reference count). If no error reported in
the IOCB status, the command Port ID field is used to determine whether
this is a point-to-point topology or a fabric topology: if the Port ID
field is assigned, it is a fabric topology; otherwise, it is a
point-to-point topology. The routine \fBlpfc_cmpl_els_flogi_fabric\fP or
\fBlpfc_cmpl_els_flogi_nport\fP shall be invoked accordingly to handle the
specific topology completion conditions.
