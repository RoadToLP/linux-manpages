.SH NAME

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" ssam_nfblk_remove
.BI "(struct ssam_notifier_block *nb "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS

The notifier block to be removed.
.SH "NOTE"
This function must be synchronized by the caller with respect to
other insert, find, and/or remove calls by holding ``struct ssam_nf.lock.
Furthermore, the caller _must_ ensure SRCU synchronization by calling
\fBsynchronize_srcu\fP with nh->srcu`` after leaving the critical section, to
ensure that the removed notifier block is not in use any more.
