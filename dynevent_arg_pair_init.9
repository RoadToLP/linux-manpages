.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "arg_pair" 12
A pointer to the dynevent_arg_pair struct representing the arg

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Initialize a dynevent_arg_pair object.  A dynevent_arg_pair
represents an object used to append argument pairs such as 'type
variable_name;' or 'x+y' to the current command string.  An
argument pair consists of a left-hand-side argument and a
right-hand-side argument separated by an operator, which can be
whitespace, all followed by a separator, if applicable.  After the
first arg string is successfully appended to the command string,
the optional \fIoperator\fP is appended, followed by the second arg and
optional \fIseparator\fP.  If no separator was specified when
initializing the arg, a space will be appended.
