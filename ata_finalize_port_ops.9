ata_port_operations to finalize

An ata_port_operations can inherit from another ops and that
ops can again inherit from another.  This can go on as many
times as necessary as long as there is no loop in the
inheritance chain.

Ops tables are finalized when the host is started.  NULL or
unspecified entries are inherited from the closet ancestor
which has the method and the entry is populated with it.
After finalization, the ops table directly points to all the
methods and ->inherits is no longer necessary and cleared.

Using ATA_OP_NULL, inheriting ops can force a method to NULL.

LOCKING:
None.
