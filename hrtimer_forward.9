.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Forward the timer expiry so it will expire in the future.
Returns the number of overruns.

Can be safely called from the callback function of \fItimer\fP. If
called from other contexts \fItimer\fP must neither be enqueued nor
running the callback and the caller needs to take care of
serialization.
.SH "NOTE"
This only updates the timer expiry value and does not requeue
the timer.
