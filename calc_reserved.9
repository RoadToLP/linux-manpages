calc_reserved \- Calculate the number of blocks to keep reserved
.SH SYNOPSIS

.BI "(struct gfs2_sbd *sdp "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "sdp" 12
The GFS2 superblock
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This is complex.  We need to reserve room for all our currently used
metadata blocks (e.g. normal file I/O rewriting file time stamps) and
all our journaled data blocks for journaled files (e.g. files in the
meta_fs like rindex, or files for which chattr +j was done.)
If we don't reserve enough space, corruption will follow.

We can have metadata blocks and jdata blocks in the same journal.  Each
type gets its own log descriptor, for which we need to reserve a block.
In fact, each type has the potential for needing more than one log descriptor
in cases where we have more blocks than will fit in a log descriptor.
Metadata journal entries take up half the space of journaled buffer entries.

Also, we need to reserve blocks for revoke journal entries and one for an
overall header for the lot.
.SH "RETURN"
the number of blocks reserved
