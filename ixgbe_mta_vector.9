.SH NAME
ixgbe_mta_vector \- Determines bit-vector in multicast table to set
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "s32" ixgbe_mta_vector
.BI "(struct ixgbe_hw *hw "  ","
.BI "u8 *mc_addr "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "hw" 12
pointer to hardware structure
.IP "mc_addr" 12
the multicast address

Extracts the 12 bits, from a multicast address, to determine which
bit-vector to set in the multicast table. The hardware uses 12 bits, from
incoming rx multicast addresses, to determine the bit-vector to check in
the MTA. Which of the 4 combination, of 12-bits, the hardware uses is set
by the MO field of the MCSTCTRL. The MO field is set during initialization
to mc_filter_type.
