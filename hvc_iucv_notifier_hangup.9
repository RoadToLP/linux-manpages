.SH NAME
hvc_iucv_notifier_hangup \- HVC notifier for TTY hangups.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" hvc_iucv_notifier_hangup
.BI "(struct hvc_struct *hp "  ","
.BI "int id "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "hp" 12
Pointer to the HVC device (struct hvc_struct)
.IP "id" 12
Additional data (originally passed to hvc_alloc):
the index of an struct hvc_iucv_private instance.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This routine notifies the HVC back-end that a tty hangup (carrier loss,
virtual or otherwise) has occurred.
The z/VM IUCV HVC device driver ignores virtual hangups (\fBvhangup\fP)
to keep an existing IUCV communication path established.
(Background: \fBvhangup\fP is called from user space (by getty or login) to
disable writing to the tty by other applications).
If the tty has been opened and an established IUCV path has been severed
(we caused the tty hangup), the function calls \fBhvc_iucv_cleanup\fP.

Locking:     struct hvc_iucv_private->lock
