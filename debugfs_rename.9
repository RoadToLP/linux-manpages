.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function renames a file/directory in debugfs.  The target must not
exist for rename to succeed.

This function will return a pointer to old_dentry (which is updated to
reflect renaming) if it succeeds. If an error occurs, NULL will be
returned.

If debugfs is not enabled in the kernel, the value -ENODEV will be
returned.
