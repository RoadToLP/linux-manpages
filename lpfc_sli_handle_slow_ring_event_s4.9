.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function is called from the worker thread when there is a pending
ELS response iocb on the driver internal slow-path response iocb worker
queue. The caller does not hold any lock. The function will remove each
response iocb from the response worker queue and calls the handle
response iocb routine (lpfc_sli_sp_handle_rspiocb) to process it.
