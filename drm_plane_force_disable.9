.SH NAME
drm_plane_force_disable \- Forcibly disable a plane
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" drm_plane_force_disable
.BI "(struct drm_plane *plane "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "plane" 12
plane to disable
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Forces the plane to be disabled.

Used when the plane's current framebuffer is destroyed,
and when restoring fbdev mode.

Note that this function is not suitable for atomic drivers, since it doesn't
wire through the lock acquisition context properly and hence can't handle
retries or driver private locks. You probably want to use
\fBdrm_atomic_helper_disable_plane\fP or
\fBdrm_atomic_helper_disable_planes_on_crtc\fP instead.
