.SH "DESCRIPTION"
BSSID masking is a method used by AR5212 and newer hardware to inform PCU
which bits of the interface's MAC address should be looked at when trying
to decide which packets to ACK. In station mode and AP mode with a single
BSS every bit matters since we lock to only one BSS. In AP mode with
multiple BSSes (virtual interfaces) not every bit matters because hw must
accept frames for all BSSes and so we tweak some bits of our mac address
in order to have multiple BSSes.

For more information check out ../hw.c of the common ath module.
