the hash table to destroy
.IP "free_fn" 12
callback to release resources of element
.IP "arg" 12
pointer passed to free_fn
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Stops an eventual async resize. If defined, invokes free_fn for each
element to releasal resources. Please note that RCU protected
readers may still be accessing the elements. Releasing of resources
must occur in a compatible manner. Then frees the bucket array.

This function will eventually sleep to wait for an async resize
to complete. The caller is responsible that no further write operations
occurs in parallel.
