dentry to set ops on
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Casefolded directories need d_hash and d_compare set, so that the dentries
contained in them are handled case-insensitively.  Note that these operations
are needed on the parent directory rather than on the dentries in it, and
while the casefolding flag can be toggled on and off on an empty directory,
dentry_operations can't be changed later.  As a result, if the filesystem has
casefolding support enabled at all, we have to give all dentries the
casefolding operations even if their inode doesn't have the casefolding flag
currently (and thus the casefolding ops would be no-ops for now).

Encryption works differently in that the only dentry operation it needs is
d_revalidate, which it only needs on dentries that have the no-key name flag.
The no-key flag can't be set "later", so we don't have to worry about that.

Finally, to maximize compatibility with overlayfs (which isn't compatible
with certain dentry operations) and to avoid taking an unnecessary
performance hit, we use custom dentry_operations for each possible
combination rather than always installing all operations.
