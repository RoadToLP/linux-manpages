This function ensures that upon next UBI attach a full scan
is issued. We need this if UBI is about to write a new fastmap
but is unable to do so. In this case we have two options:
a) Make sure that the current fastmap will not be usued upon
attach time and contine or b) fall back to RO mode to have the
current fastmap in a valid state.
Returns 0 on success, < 0 indicates an internal error.
