.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This wrapper is the free function that matches \fBhfi1_create_ctxtdata\fP.
When a context is done being used (kernel or user), this function is called
for the "final" put to match the kref init from \fBhf1i_create_ctxtdata\fP.
Other users of the context do a get/put sequence to make sure that the
structure isn't removed while in use.
