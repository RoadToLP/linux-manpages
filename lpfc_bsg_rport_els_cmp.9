.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function is the completion handler for iocbs issued using
lpfc_bsg_rport_els_cmp function. This function is called by the
ring event handler function without any lock held. This function
can be called from both worker thread context and interrupt
context. This function also can be called from other thread which
cleans up the SLI layer objects.
This function copies the contents of the response iocb to the
response iocb memory object provided by the caller of
lpfc_sli_issue_iocb_wait and then wakes up the thread which
sleeps for the iocb completion.
