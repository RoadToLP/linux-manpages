.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This routine checks whether there are more remaining Port Logins
(PLOGI) to be issued for the \fIvport\fP. If so, it will invoke the routine
\fBlpfc_els_disc_plogi\fP to go through the Node Port Recovery (NPR) nodes
to issue ELS PLOGIs up to the configured discover threads with the
\fIvport\fP (\fIvport->cfg_discovery_threads\fP). The function also decrement
the \fIvport\fP's num_disc_node by 1 if it is not already 0.
