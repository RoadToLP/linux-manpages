.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Copies and unflattens the device-tree passed by the firmware, creating the
tree of struct device_node. It also fills the "name" and "type"
pointers of the nodes so the normal device-tree walking functions
can be used. This should only be used when the FDT memory has not been
reserved such is the case when the FDT is built-in to the kernel init
section. If the FDT memory is reserved already then unflatten_device_tree
should be used instead.
