.SH NAME
lpfc_initialize_node \- Initialize all fields of node object
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" lpfc_initialize_node
.BI "(struct lpfc_vport *vport "  ","
.BI "struct lpfc_nodelist *ndlp "  ","
.BI "uint32_t did "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "vport" 12
Pointer to Virtual Port object.
.IP "ndlp" 12
Pointer to FC node object.
.IP "did" 12
FC_ID of the node.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function is always called when node object need to be initialized.
It initializes all the fields of the node object. Although the reference
to phba from \fIndlp\fP can be obtained indirectly through it's reference to
\fIvport\fP, a direct reference to phba is taken here by \fIndlp\fP. This is due
to the life-span of the \fIndlp\fP might go beyond the existence of \fIvport\fP as
the final release of ndlp is determined by its reference count. And, the
operation on \fIndlp\fP needs the reference to phba.
