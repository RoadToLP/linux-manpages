.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" drm_atomic_helper_commit_tail
.BI "(struct drm_atomic_state *old_state "  ");"

atomic state object with old state structures
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This is the default implementation for the
\fIdrm_mode_config_helper_funcs.atomic_commit_tail\fP hook, for drivers
that do not support runtime_pm or do not need the CRTC to be
enabled to perform a commit. Otherwise, see
\fBdrm_atomic_helper_commit_tail_rpm\fP.

Note that the default ordering of how the various stages are called is to
match the legacy modeset helper library closest.
