.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "res" 12
Pointer to a struct vmw_res embedded in a struct
vmw_surface.
.IP "val_buf" 12
Pointer to a struct ttm_validate_buffer containing
information about the backup buffer.
.IP "bind" 12
Boolean wether to DMA to the surface.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Transfer backup data to or from a legacy surface as part of the
validation process.
May return other errors if the kernel is out of guest resources.
The backup buffer will be fenced or idle upon successful completion,
and if the surface needs persistent backup storage, the backup buffer
will also be returned reserved iff \fIbind\fP is true.
