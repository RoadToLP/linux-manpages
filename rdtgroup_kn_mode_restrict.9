.BI "(struct rdtgroup *r "  ","
.BI "const char *name "  ");"

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The permissions of named resctrl file, directory, or link are modified
to not allow read, write, or execute by any user.

WARNING: This function is intended to communicate to the user that the
resctrl file has been locked down - that it is not relevant to the
particular state the system finds itself in. It should not be relied
on to protect from user access because after the file's permissions
are restricted the user can still change the permissions using chmod
from the command line.
.SH "RETURN"
0 on success, <0 on failure.
