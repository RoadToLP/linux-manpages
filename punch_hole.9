.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Punch a hole into a file or truncate a file at a given position.  This
function operates in whole blocks (\fIoffset\fP and \fIlength\fP are rounded
accordingly); partially filled blocks must be cleared otherwise.

This function works from the bottom up, and from the right to the left. In
other words, it strips off the highest layer (data) before stripping any of
the metadata. Doing it this way is best in case the operation is interrupted
by power failure, etc.  The dinode is rewritten in every transaction to
guarantee integrity.
