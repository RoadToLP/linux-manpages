.SH NAME
dwmac1000_validate_mcast_bins \- validates the number of Multicast filter bins
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" dwmac1000_validate_mcast_bins
.BI "(struct device *dev "  ","
.BI "int mcast_bins "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dev" 12
struct device of the platform device
.IP "mcast_bins" 12
Multicast filtering bins
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
this function validates the number of Multicast filtering bins specified
by the configuration through the device tree. The Synopsys GMAC supports
64 bins, 128 bins, or 256 bins. "bins" refer to the division of CRC
number space. 64 bins correspond to 6 bits of the CRC, 128 corresponds
to 7 bits, and 256 refers to 8 bits of the CRC. Any other setting is
invalid and will cause the filtering algorithm to use Multicast
promiscuous mode.
