.SH NAME
s3c_fb_update_palette \- set or schedule a palette update.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" s3c_fb_update_palette
.BI "(struct s3c_fb *sfb "  ","
.BI "struct s3c_fb_win *win "  ","
.BI "unsigned int reg "  ","
.BI "u32 value "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "sfb" 12
The hardware information.
.IP "win" 12
The window being updated.
.IP "reg" 12
The palette index being changed.
.IP "value" 12
The computed palette value.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Change the value of a palette register, either by directly writing to
the palette (this requires the palette RAM to be disconnected from the
hardware whilst this is in progress) or schedule the update for later.

At the moment, since we have no VSYNC interrupt support, we simply set
the palette entry directly.
