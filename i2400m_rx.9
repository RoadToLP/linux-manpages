.SH NAME
i2400m_rx \- Receive a buffer of data from the device
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" i2400m_rx
.BI "(struct i2400m *i2400m "  ","
.BI "struct sk_buff *skb "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "i2400m" 12
device descriptor
.IP "skb" 12
skbuff where the data has been received
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Parse in a buffer of data that contains an RX message sent from the
device. See the file header for the format. Run all checks on the
buffer header, then run over each payload's descriptors, verify
their consistency and act on each payload's contents.  If
everything is successful, update the device's statistics.

0 if ok, < 0 errno on error

If ok, this function owns now the skb and the caller DOESN'T have
to run \fBkfree_skb\fP on it. However, on error, the caller still owns
the skb and it is responsible for releasing it.
.SH "NOTE"
You need to set the skb to contain only the length of the
received buffer; for that, use skb_trim(skb, RECEIVED_SIZE).
.SH "RETURN"
