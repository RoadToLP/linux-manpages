.SH NAME
fixed_power_int \- compute: x^n, in O(log n) time
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "unsigned long" fixed_power_int
.BI "(unsigned long x "  ","
.BI "unsigned int frac_bits "  ","
.BI "unsigned int n "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "x" 12
base of the power
.IP "frac_bits" 12
fractional bits of \fIx\fP
.IP "n" 12
power to raise \fIx\fP to.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
By exploiting the relation between the definition of the natural power
function: x^n := x*x*...*x (x multiplied by itself for n times), and
the binary encoding of numbers used by computers: n := \Sum n_i * 2^i,
(where: n_i \elem {0, 1}, the binary vector representing n),
we find: x^n := x^(\Sum n_i * 2^i) := \Prod x^(n_i * 2^i), which is
of course trivially computable in O(log_2 n), the length of our binary
vector.
