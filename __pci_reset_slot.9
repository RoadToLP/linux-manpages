PCI slot to reset
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
A PCI bus may host multiple slots, each slot may support a reset mechanism
independent of other slots.  For instance, some slots may support slot power
control.  In the case of a 1:1 bus to slot architecture, this function may
wrap the bus reset to avoid spurious slot related events such as hotplug.
Generally a slot reset should be attempted before a bus reset.  All of the
function of the slot and any subordinate buses behind the slot are reset
through this function.  PCI config space of all devices in the slot and
behind the slot is saved before and restored after reset.

Same as above except return -EAGAIN if the slot cannot be locked
