.SH NAME
ice_reset_all_vfs \- reset all allocated VFs in one go
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "bool" ice_reset_all_vfs
.BI "(struct ice_pf *pf "  ","
.BI "bool is_vflr "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "pf" 12
pointer to the PF structure
.IP "is_vflr" 12
true if VFLR was issued, false if not
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
First, tell the hardware to reset each VF, then do all the waiting in one
chunk, and finally finish restoring each VF after the wait. This is useful
during PF routines which need to reset all VFs, as otherwise it must perform
these resets in a serialized fashion.

Returns true if any VFs were reset, and false otherwise.
