.SH NAME
pm_clk_list_lock \- ensure exclusive access for modifying the PM clock entry list.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" pm_clk_list_lock
.BI "(struct pm_subsys_data *psd "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "psd" 12
pm_subsys_data instance corresponding to the PM clock entry list
and clk_op_might_sleep count to be modified.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Get exclusive access before modifying the PM clock entry list and the
clock_op_might_sleep count to guard against concurrent modifications.
This also protects against a concurrent clock_op_might_sleep and PM clock
entry list usage in \fBpm_clk_suspend\fP/\fBpm_clk_resume\fP that may or may not
happen in atomic context, hence both the mutex and the spinlock must be
taken here.
