This function is the ISR handler of the device. It
identifies the reason for the interrupt and calls the relevant
service routines. As a contongency measure, this ISR allocates the
recv buffers, if their numbers are below the panic value which is
presently set to 25% of the original number of rcv buffers allocated.
Return value:
IRQ_HANDLED: will be returned if IRQ was handled by this routine
IRQ_NONE: will be returned if interrupt is not from our device
