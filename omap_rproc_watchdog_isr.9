.SH NAME
omap_rproc_watchdog_isr \- Watchdog ISR handler for remoteproc device
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "irqreturn_t" omap_rproc_watchdog_isr
.BI "(int irq "  ","
.BI "void *data "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "irq" 12
IRQ number associated with a watchdog timer
.IP "data" 12
IRQ handler data
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This ISR routine executes the required necessary low-level code to
acknowledge a watchdog timer interrupt. There can be multiple watchdog
timers associated with a rproc (like IPUs which have 2 watchdog timers,
one per Cortex M3/M4 core), so a lookup has to be performed to identify
the timer to acknowledge its interrupt.

The function also invokes rproc_report_crash to report the watchdog event
to the remoteproc driver core, to trigger a recovery.
.SH "RETURN"
IRQ_HANDLED on success, otherwise IRQ_NONE
