.SH NAME
trace_array_get_by_name \- Create/Lookup a trace array, given its name.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "struct trace_array *" trace_array_get_by_name
.BI "(const char *name "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "name" 12
The name of the trace array to be looked up/created.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Returns pointer to trace array with given name.
NULL, if it cannot be created.
.SH "NOTE"
This function increments the reference counter associated with the
trace array returned. This makes sure it cannot be freed while in use.
Use \fBtrace_array_put\fP once the trace array is no longer needed.
If the trace_array is to be freed, \fBtrace_array_destroy\fP needs to
be called after the \fBtrace_array_put\fP, or simply let user space delete
it from the tracefs instances directory. But until the
\fBtrace_array_put\fP is called, user space can not delete it.
