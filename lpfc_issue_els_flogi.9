lpfc_issue_els_flogi \- Issue an flogi iocb command for a vport
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" lpfc_issue_els_flogi
.BI "(struct lpfc_vport *vport "  ","
.BI "struct lpfc_nodelist *ndlp "  ","
.BI "uint8_t retry "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "vport" 12
pointer to a host virtual N_Port data structure.
.IP "ndlp" 12
pointer to a node-list data structure.
.IP "retry" 12
number of retries to the command IOCB.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This routine issues a Fabric Login (FLOGI) Request ELS command
for a \fIvport\fP. The initiator service parameters are put into the payload
of the FLOGI Request IOCB and the top-level callback function pointer
to \fBlpfc_cmpl_els_flogi\fP routine is put to the IOCB completion callback
function field. The lpfc_issue_fabric_iocb routine is invoked to send
out FLOGI ELS command with one outstanding fabric IOCB at a time.

Note that, in \fBlpfc_prep_els_iocb\fP routine, the reference count of ndlp
will be incremented by 1 for holding the ndlp and the reference to ndlp
will be stored into the context1 field of the IOCB for the completion
callback function to the FLOGI ELS command.

Return code
0 - successfully issued flogi iocb for \fIvport\fP
1 - failed to issue flogi iocb for \fIvport\fP
