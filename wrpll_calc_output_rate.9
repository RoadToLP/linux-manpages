.SH NAME
wrpll_calc_output_rate \- calculate the PLL's target output rate
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "unsigned long" wrpll_calc_output_rate
.BI "(const struct wrpll_cfg *c "  ","
.BI "unsigned long parent_rate "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "c" 12
ptr to a struct wrpll_cfg record to read from
.IP "parent_rate" 12
PLL refclk rate
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Given a pointer to the PLL's current input configuration \fIc\fP and the
PLL's input reference clock rate \fIparent_rate\fP (before the R
pre-divider), calculate the PLL's output clock rate (after the Q
post-divider).
.SH "CONTEXT"
Any context.  Caller must protect the memory pointed to by \fIc\fP
from simultaneous modification.
.SH "RETURN"
the PLL's output clock rate, in Hz.  The return value from
this function is intended to be convenient to pass directly
to the Linux clock framework; thus there is no explicit
error return value.
