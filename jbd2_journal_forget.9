.SH NAME
jbd2_journal_forget \- bforget() for potentially-journaled buffers.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" jbd2_journal_forget
.BI "(handle_t *handle "  ","
.BI "struct buffer_head *bh "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "handle" 12
transaction handle
.IP "bh" 12
bh to 'forget'
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
We can only do the bforget if there are no commits pending against the
buffer.  If the buffer is dirty in the current running transaction we
can safely unlink it.

bh may not be a journalled buffer at all - it may be a non-JBD
buffer which came off the hashtable.  Check for this.

Decrements bh->b_count by one.

Allow this call even if the handle has aborted --- it may be part of
the caller's cleanup after an abort.
