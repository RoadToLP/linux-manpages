.SH NAME
omap2_clkops_enable_clkdm \- increment usecount on clkdm of @hw
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" omap2_clkops_enable_clkdm
.BI "(struct clk_hw *hw "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "hw" 12
struct clk_hw * of the clock being enabled
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Increment the usecount of the clockdomain of the clock pointed to
by \fIhw\fP; if the usecount is 1, the clockdomain will be "enabled."
Only needed for clocks that don't use \fBomap2_dflt_clk_enable\fP as
their enable function pointer.  Passes along the return value of
\fBclkdm_clk_enable\fP, -EINVAL if \fIhw\fP is not associated with a
clockdomain, or 0 if clock framework-based clockdomain control is
not implemented.
