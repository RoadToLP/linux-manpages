.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This may be called from the VFS directly, or from within GFS2 with the
inode locked, so we look to see if the glock is already locked and only
lock the glock if its not already been done. Note that its the NFS
readdirplus operation which causes this to be called (from filldir)
with the glock already held.
.SH "RETURN"
errno
