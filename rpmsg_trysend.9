.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function sends \fIdata\fP of length \fIlen\fP on the \fIept\fP endpoint.
The message will be sent to the remote processor which the \fIept\fP
endpoint belongs to, using \fIept\fP's address as source and its associated
rpdev's address as destination.
In case there are no TX buffers available, the function will immediately
return -ENOMEM without waiting until one becomes available.

Can only be called from process context (for now).

Returns 0 on success and an appropriate error value on failure.
