.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The provided MMIO region must be mapped prior to call. The sequence to
reset the port involves toggling it offline and then back online. This
action can cause this routine to delay up to a few seconds. An effort
is made to maintain link with the device by switching to host to use
the alternate port exclusively while the reset takes place.
failure to come online is overridden.
