.SH NAME
e1000e_phy_force_speed_duplex_m88 \- Force speed/duplex for m88 PHY
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "s32" e1000e_phy_force_speed_duplex_m88
.BI "(struct e1000_hw *hw "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "hw" 12
pointer to the HW structure

Calls the PHY setup function to force speed and duplex.  Clears the
auto-crossover to force MDI manually.  Resets the PHY to commit the
changes.  If time expires while waiting for link up, we reset the DSP.
After reset, TX_CLK and CRS on Tx must be set.  Return successful upon
successful completion, else return corresponding error code.
