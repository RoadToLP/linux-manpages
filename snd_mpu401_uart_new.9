.SH NAME
snd_mpu401_uart_new \- create an MPU401-UART instance
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" snd_mpu401_uart_new
.BI "(struct snd_card *card "  ","
.BI "int device "  ","
.BI "unsigned short hardware "  ","
.BI "unsigned long port "  ","
.BI "unsigned int info_flags "  ","
.BI "int irq "  ","
.BI "struct snd_rawmidi ** rrawmidi "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "card" 12
the card instance
.IP "device" 12
the device index, zero-based
.IP "hardware" 12
the hardware type, MPU401_HW_XXXX
.IP "port" 12
the base address of MPU401 port
.IP "info_flags" 12
bitflags MPU401_INFO_XXX
.IP "irq" 12
the ISA irq number, -1 if not to be allocated
.IP "rrawmidi" 12
the pointer to store the new rawmidi instance
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Creates a new MPU-401 instance.

Note that the rawmidi instance is returned on the rrawmidi argument,
not the mpu401 instance itself.  To access to the mpu401 instance,
cast from rawmidi->private_data (with struct snd_mpu401 magic-cast).
.SH "RETURN"
Zero if successful, or a negative error code.
