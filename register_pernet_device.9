pernet operations structure for the subsystem

Register a device which has init and exit functions
that are called when network namespaces are created and
destroyed respectively.

When registered all network namespace init functions are
called for every existing network namespace.  Allowing kernel
modules to have a race free view of the set of network namespaces.

When a new network namespace is created all of the init
methods are called in the order in which they were registered.

When a network namespace is destroyed all of the exit methods
are called in the reverse of the order with which they were
registered.
