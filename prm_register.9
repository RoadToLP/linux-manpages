.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Register per-SoC low-level OMAP PRM data and function pointers with

pointed to by \fIpld\fP valid until it calls \fBprm_unregister\fP and
it returns successfully.  Returns 0 upon success, -EINVAL if \fIpld\fP
is NULL, or -EEXIST if \fBprm_register\fP has already been called
without an intervening \fBprm_unregister\fP.
