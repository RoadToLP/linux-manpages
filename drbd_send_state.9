.SH NAME
drbd_send_state \- After a state change, sends the new state to the peer
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" drbd_send_state
.BI "(struct drbd_peer_device *peer_device "  ","
.BI "union drbd_state state "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "peer_device" 12
DRBD peer device.
.IP "state" 12
the state to send, not necessarily the current state.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Each state change queues an "after_state_ch" work, which will eventually
send the resulting new state to the peer. If more state changes happen
between queuing and processing of the after_state_ch work, we still
want to send each intermediary state in the order it occurred.
