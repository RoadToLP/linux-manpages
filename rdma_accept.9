.SH NAME
rdma_accept \- Called to accept a connection request or response.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" rdma_accept
.BI "(struct rdma_cm_id *id "  ","
.BI "struct rdma_conn_param *conn_param "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "id" 12
Connection identifier associated with the request.
.IP "conn_param" 12
Information needed to establish the connection.  This must be
provided if accepting a connection request.  If accepting a connection
response, this parameter must be NULL.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Typically, this routine is only called by the listener to accept a connection
request.  It must also be called on the active side of a connection if the
user is performing their own QP transitions.

In the case of error, a reject message is sent to the remote side and the
state of the qp associated with the id is modified to error, such that any
previously posted receive buffers would be flushed.

This function is for use by kernel ULPs and must be called from under the
handler callback.
