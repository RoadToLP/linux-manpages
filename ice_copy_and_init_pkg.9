.SH NAME
ice_copy_and_init_pkg \- initialize/download a copy of the package
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "enum ice_status" ice_copy_and_init_pkg
.BI "(struct ice_hw *hw "  ","
.BI "const u8 *buf "  ","
.BI "u32 len "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "hw" 12
pointer to the hardware structure
.IP "buf" 12
pointer to the package buffer
.IP "len" 12
size of the package buffer
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function copies the package buffer, and then calls \fBice_init_pkg\fP to
initialize the copied package contents.

The copying is necessary if the package buffer supplied is constant, or if
the memory may disappear shortly after calling this function.

If the package buffer resides in the data segment and can be modified, the
caller is free to use \fBice_init_pkg\fP instead of \fBice_copy_and_init_pkg\fP.

However, if the package buffer needs to be copied first, such as when being
read from a file, the caller should use \fBice_copy_and_init_pkg\fP.

This function will first copy the package buffer, before calling
\fBice_init_pkg\fP. The caller is free to immediately destroy the original
package buffer, as the new copy will be managed by this function and
related routines.
