.SH NAME
rtc_set_offset \- Adjusts the duration of the average second
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" rtc_set_offset
.BI "(struct rtc_device *rtc "  ","
.BI "long offset "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "rtc" 12
rtc device to be used
.IP "offset" 12
the offset in parts per billion
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Some rtc's allow an adjustment to the average duration of a second
to compensate for differences in the actual clock rate due to temperature,
the crystal, capacitor, etc.

The adjustment applied is as follows:
t = t0 * (1 + offset * 1e-9)
where t0 is the measured length of 1 RTC second with offset = 0

Kernel interface to adjust an rtc clock offset.
Return 0 on success, or a negative number on error.
If the rtc offset is not setable (or not implemented), return -EINVAL
