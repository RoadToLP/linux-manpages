.SH "DESCRIPTION"

When events are being filtered, it is quicker to use a temporary
buffer to write the event data into if there's a likely chance
that it will not be committed. The discard of the ring buffer
is not as fast as committing, and is much slower than copying
a commit.

When an event is to be filtered, allocate per cpu buffers to
write the event data into, and if the event is filtered and discarded
it is simply dropped, otherwise, the entire data is to be committed
in one shot.
