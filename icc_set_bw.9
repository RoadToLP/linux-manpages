.SH NAME
icc_set_bw \- set bandwidth constraints on an interconnect path
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" icc_set_bw
.BI "(struct icc_path *path "  ","
.BI "u32 avg_bw "  ","
.BI "u32 peak_bw "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "path" 12
reference to the path returned by \fBicc_get\fP
.IP "avg_bw" 12
average bandwidth in kilobytes per second
.IP "peak_bw" 12
peak bandwidth in kilobytes per second
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function is used by an interconnect consumer to express its own needs
in terms of bandwidth for a previously requested path between two endpoints.
The requests are aggregated and each node is updated accordingly. The entire
path is locked by a mutex to ensure that the \fBset\fP is completed.
The \fIpath\fP can be NULL when the "interconnects" DT properties is missing,
which will mean that no constraints will be set.

Returns 0 on success, or an appropriate error code otherwise.
