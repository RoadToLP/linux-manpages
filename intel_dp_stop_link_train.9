.SH NAME
intel_dp_stop_link_train \- stop link training
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" intel_dp_stop_link_train
.BI "(struct intel_dp *intel_dp "  ","
.BI "const struct intel_crtc_state *crtc_state "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "intel_dp" 12
DP struct
.IP "crtc_state" 12
state for CRTC attached to the encoder
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Stop the link training of the \fIintel_dp\fP port, disabling the training
pattern in the sink's DPCD, and disabling the test pattern symbol
generation on the port.

What symbols are output on the port after this point is
platform specific: On DDI/VLV/CHV platforms it will be the idle pattern
with the pipe being disabled, on older platforms it's HW specific if/how an
idle pattern is generated, as the pipe is already enabled here for those.

This function must be called after \fBintel_dp_start_link_train\fP.
