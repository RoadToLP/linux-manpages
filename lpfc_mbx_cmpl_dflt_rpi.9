.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This routine is the completion callback function for unregister default
RPI (Remote Port Index) mailbox command to the \fIphba\fP. It simply releases
the associated lpfc Direct Memory Access (DMA) buffer back to the pool and
decrements the ndlp reference count held for this completion callback
function. After that, it invokes the \fBlpfc_nlp_not_used\fP to check
whether there is only one reference left on the ndlp. If so, it will
perform one more decrement and trigger the release of the ndlp.
