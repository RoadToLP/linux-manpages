.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Creates a fence object and submits a command stream marker.
If this fails for some reason, We sync the fifo and return NULL.
It is then safe to fence buffers with a NULL pointer.

If \fIp_handle\fP is not NULL \fIfile_priv\fP must also not be NULL. Creates a
userspace handle if \fIp_handle\fP is not NULL, otherwise not.
