device structure

Register a miscellaneous device with the kernel. If the minor
number is set to MISC_DYNAMIC_MINOR a minor number is assigned
and placed in the minor field of the structure. For other cases
the minor number requested is used.

The structure passed is linked into the kernel and may not be
destroyed until it has been unregistered. By default, an \fBopen\fP
syscall to the device sets file->private_data to point to the
structure. Drivers don't need open in fops for this.

A zero is returned on success and a negative errno code for
failure.
