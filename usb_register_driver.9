Registers a USB interface driver with the USB core.  The list of
unattached interfaces will be rescanned whenever a new driver is
added, allowing the new driver to attach to any recognized interfaces.
.SH "RETURN"
A negative error code on failure and 0 on success.
.SH "NOTE"
if you want your driver to use the USB major number, you must call
\fBusb_register_dev\fP to enable that functionality.  This function no longer
takes care of that.
