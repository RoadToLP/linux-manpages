.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The power control registers is a set of one-time-programmable registers
in its own register space, accessed by writing addess bits to these
two registers: bits 7,6,5 of PCTL_REG_LO corresponds to the 3 LSBs of
the address and bits 8,9 of PCTL_REG_HI corresponds to the 2 MSBs of
the address, forming an address space of 5 bits, i.e. 32 registers
0x00 ... 0x1f can be obtained.
