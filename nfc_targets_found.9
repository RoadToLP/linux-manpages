.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" nfc_targets_found
.BI "(struct nfc_dev *dev "  ","
.BI "struct nfc_target *targets "  ","
.BI "int n_targets "  ");"

.IP "dev" 12
The nfc device that found the targets
.IP "targets" 12

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The device driver must call this function when one or many nfc targets
are found. After calling this function, the device driver must stop
polling for targets.
.SH "NOTE"
This function can be called with targets=NULL and n_targets=0 to
notify a driver error, meaning that the polling operation cannot complete.
IMPORTANT: this function must not be called from an atomic context.
In addition, it must also not be called from a context that would prevent
the NFC Core to call other nfc ops entry point concurrently.
