drm_gem_fence_array_add_implicit \- Adds the implicit dependencies tracked in the GEM object's reservation object to an array of dma_fences for use in scheduling a rendering job.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" drm_gem_fence_array_add_implicit
.BI "(struct xarray *fence_array "  ","
.BI "struct drm_gem_object *obj "  ","
.BI "bool write "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "fence_array" 12
array of dma_fence * for the job to block on.
.IP "obj" 12
the gem object to add new dependencies from.
.IP "write" 12
whether the job might write the object (so we need to depend on
shared fences in the reservation object).
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

This should be called after \fBdrm_gem_lock_reservations\fP on your array of
GEM objects used in the job but before updating the reservations with your
own fences.
