.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This is a helper function which search branch with key \fIkey\fP in \fIznode\fP using
binary search. The result of the search may be:
o exact match, then 1 is returned, and the slot number of the branch is
stored in \fIn\fP;
o no exact match, then 0 is returned and the slot number of the left
closest branch is returned in \fIn\fP; the slot if all keys in this znode are
greater than \fIkey\fP, then -1 is returned in \fIn\fP.
