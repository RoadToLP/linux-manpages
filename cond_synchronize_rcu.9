.SH NAME
cond_synchronize_rcu \- Conditionally wait for an RCU grace period
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" cond_synchronize_rcu
.BI "(unsigned long oldstate "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "oldstate" 12
return value from earlier call to \fBget_state_synchronize_rcu\fP
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
If a full RCU grace period has elapsed since the earlier call to
\fBget_state_synchronize_rcu\fP, just return.  Otherwise, invoke
\fBsynchronize_rcu\fP to wait for a full grace period.

Yes, this function does not take counter wrap into account.  But
counter wrap is harmless.  If the counter wraps, we have waited for
more than 2 billion grace periods (and way more on a 64-bit system!),
so waiting for one additional grace period should be just fine.
