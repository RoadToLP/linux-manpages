.SH NAME
lpfc_els_retry_delay \- Timer function with a ndlp delayed function timer
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" lpfc_els_retry_delay
.BI "(struct timer_list *t "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "t" 12
pointer to the timer function associated data (ndlp).
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This routine is invoked by the ndlp delayed-function timer to check
whether there is any pending ELS retry event(s) with the node. If not, it
simply returns. Otherwise, if there is at least one ELS delayed event, it
adds the delayed events to the HBA work list and invokes the
\fBlpfc_worker_wake_up\fP routine to wake up worker thread to process the
event. Note that \fBlpfc_nlp_get\fP is called before posting the event to
the work list to hold reference count of ndlp so that it guarantees the
reference to ndlp will still be available when the worker thread gets
to the event associated with the ndlp.
