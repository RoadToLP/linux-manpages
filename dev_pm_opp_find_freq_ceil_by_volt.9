.SH NAME
dev_pm_opp_find_freq_ceil_by_volt \- Find OPP with highest frequency for target voltage.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "struct dev_pm_opp *" dev_pm_opp_find_freq_ceil_by_volt
.BI "(struct device *dev "  ","
.BI "unsigned long u_volt "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dev" 12
Device for which we do this operation.
.IP "u_volt" 12
Target voltage.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Search for OPP with highest (ceil) frequency and has voltage <= u_volt.

Error return values can be:
EINVAL:      bad parameters

The callers are required to call \fBdev_pm_opp_put\fP for the returned OPP after
use.
.SH "RETURN"
matching *opp, else returns ERR_PTR in case of error which should be
handled using IS_ERR.
