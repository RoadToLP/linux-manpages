.SH NAME
spum_hash_type \- Determine the type of hash operation.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "enum hash_type" spum_hash_type
.BI "(u32 src_sent "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "src_sent" 12
The number of bytes in the current request that have already
been sent to the SPU to be hashed.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
We do not use HASH_TYPE_FULL for requests that fit in a single SPU message.
Using FULL causes failures (such as when the string to be hashed is empty).
For similar reasons, we never use HASH_TYPE_FIN. Instead, submit messages
as INIT or UPDT and do the hash padding in sw.
