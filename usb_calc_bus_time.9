.BI "int isoc "  ","
.BI "int bytecount "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "speed" 12
from dev->speed; USB_SPEED_{LOW,FULL,HIGH}
.IP "is_input" 12
true iff the transaction sends data to the host
.IP "isoc" 12
true for isochronous transactions, false for interrupt ones
.IP "bytecount" 12
how many bytes in the transaction.
.SH "RETURN"
Approximate bus time in nanoseconds for a periodic transaction.
.SH "NOTE"
See USB 2.0 spec section 5.11.3; only periodic transfers need to be
