.BI "int dsize "  ","
.BI "runlist_element *src "  ","
.BI "int ssize "  ","

.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dst" 12
original runlist to be worked on
.IP "dsize" 12
number of elements in \fIdst\fP (including end marker)
.IP "src" 12
new runlist to be inserted
.IP "ssize" 12
number of elements in \fIsrc\fP (excluding end marker)
.IP "loc" 12
insert the new runlist \fIsrc\fP before this element in \fIdst\fP
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Insert the runlist \fIsrc\fP before element \fIloc\fP in the runlist \fIdst\fP. Merge the
left end of the new runlist, if necessary. Adjust the size of the hole
after the inserted runlist.

It is up to the caller to serialize access to the runlists \fIdst\fP and \fIsrc\fP.

On success, return a pointer to the new, combined, runlist. Note, both
runlists \fIdst\fP and \fIsrc\fP are deallocated before returning so you cannot use
the pointers for anything any more. (Strictly speaking the returned runlist
may be the same as \fIdst\fP but this is irrelevant.)

On error, return -errno. Both runlists are left unmodified. The following
error codes are defined:
-ENOMEM - Not enough memory to allocate runlist array.
-EINVAL - Invalid parameters were passed in.
