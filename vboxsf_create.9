.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Create a new file or folder or open an existing one in a shared folder.
Note this function always returns 0 / success unless an exceptional condition
occurs - out of memory, invalid arguments, etc. If the file or folder could
not be opened or created, create_parms->handle will be set to
SHFL_HANDLE_NIL on return.  In this case the value in create_parms->result
provides information as to why (e.g. SHFL_FILE_EXISTS), create_parms->result
is also set on success as additional information.
.SH "RETURN"
0 or negative errno value.
