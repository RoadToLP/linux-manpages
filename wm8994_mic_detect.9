.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Enable microphone detection via IRQ on the WM8994.  If GPIOs are
being used to bring out signals to the processor then only platform
data configuration is needed for WM8994 and processor GPIOs should
be configured using \fBsnd_soc_jack_add_gpios\fP instead.

Configuration of detection levels is available via the micbias1_lvl
and micbias2_lvl platform data members.
