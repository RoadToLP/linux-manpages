This makes a copy of a vector of USB descriptors.  Its primary use
is to support usb_function objects which can have multiple copies,
each needing different descriptors.  Functions may have static
tables of descriptors, which are used as templates and customized
with identifiers (for interfaces, strings, endpoints, and more)
as needed by a given function instance.
