.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Outputs ATA taskfile to standard ATA host controller.
Writes the control, feature, nsect, lbal, lbam, and lbah registers.
Optionally (ATA_TFLAG_LBA48) writes hob_feature, hob_nsect,
hob_lbal, hob_lbam, and hob_lbah.

This function waits for idle (!BUSY and !DRQ) after writing
registers.  If the control register has a new value, this
function also waits for idle after writing control and before
writing the remaining registers.

LOCKING:
EH context.
