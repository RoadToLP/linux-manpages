.SH NAME
tracing_map_init \- Allocate and clear a map's tracing_map_elts
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" tracing_map_init
.BI "(struct tracing_map *map "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "map" 12
The tracing_map to initialize
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Allocates a clears a pool of tracing_map_elts equal to the
user-specified size of 2 ** map_bits (internally maintained as
'max_elts' in struct tracing_map).  Before using, the map fields
should be added to the map with \fBtracing_map_add_sum_field\fP and
\fBtracing_map_add_key_field\fP.  \fBtracing_map_init\fP should then be
called to allocate the array of tracing_map_elts, in order to avoid
allocating anything in the map insertion path.  The user-specified
map size reflects the max number of elements requested by the user
- internally we double that in order to keep the table sparse and
keep collisions manageable.

See tracing_map.h for a description of tracing_map_ops.
.SH "RETURN"
the tracing_map pointer if successful, ERR_PTR if not.
