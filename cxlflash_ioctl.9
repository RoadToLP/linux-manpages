.SH "DESCRIPTION"
A read/write semaphore is used to implement a 'drain' of currently
running ioctls. The read semaphore is taken at the beginning of each
ioctl thread and released upon concluding execution. Additionally the
semaphore should be released and then reacquired in any ioctl execution
path which will wait for an event to occur that is outside the scope of
the ioctl (i.e. an adapter reset). To drain the ioctls currently running,
a thread simply needs to acquire the write semaphore.
.SH "RETURN"
0 on success, -errno on failure
