.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Try to find an entry matching the current call in the cache. When none
is found, we try to grab the oldest expired entry off the LRU list. If
a suitable one isn't there, then drop the cache_lock and allocate a
new one, then search again in case one got inserted while this thread
didn't hold the lock.

Return values:
RC_DOIT: Process the request normally
RC_REPLY: Reply from cache
RC_DROPIT: Do not process the request further
