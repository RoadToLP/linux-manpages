.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "bat_priv" 12
the bat priv with all the soft interface information
.IP "str_proto" 12
a string for the querier protocol (e.g. "IGMP" or "MLD")
.IP "old_state" 12
the previous querier state on our link
.IP "new_state" 12
the new querier state on our link
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Outputs debug messages to the logging facility with log level 'mcast'
regarding changes to the querier status on the link which are relevant
to our multicast optimizations.

Usually this is about whether a querier appeared or vanished in
our mesh or whether the querier is in the suboptimal position of being
behind our local bridge segment: Snooping switches will directly
forward listener reports to the querier, therefore batman-adv and
the bridge will potentially not see these listeners - the querier is
potentially shadowing listeners from us then.

This is only interesting for nodes with a bridge on top of their
soft interface.
