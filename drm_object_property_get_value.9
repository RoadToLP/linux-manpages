.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function retrieves the softare state of the given property for the given
property. Since there is no driver callback to retrieve the current property
value this might be out of sync with the hardware, depending upon the driver
and property.

Atomic drivers should never call this function directly, the core will read
out property values through the various ->atomic_get_property callbacks.
.SH "RETURN"
Zero on success, error code on failure.
