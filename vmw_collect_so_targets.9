.SH NAME
vmw_collect_so_targets \- Build SVGA3dSoTarget data for a binding command without checking which bindings actually need to be emitted
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" vmw_collect_so_targets
.BI "(struct vmw_ctx_binding_state *cbs "  ","
.BI "const struct vmw_ctx_bindinfo *bi "  ","
.BI "u32 max_num "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "cbs" 12
Pointer to the context's struct vmw_ctx_binding_state
.IP "bi" 12
Pointer to where the binding info array is stored in \fIcbs\fP
.IP "max_num" 12
Maximum number of entries in the \fIbi\fP array.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Scans the \fIbi\fP array for bindings and builds a buffer of SVGA3dSoTarget data.
Stops at the first non-existing binding in the \fIbi\fP array.
On output, \fIcbs->bind_cmd_count\fP contains the number of bindings to be
emitted, \fIcbs->bind_first_slot\fP is set to zero, and \fIcbs->bind_cmd_buffer\fP
contains the command data.
