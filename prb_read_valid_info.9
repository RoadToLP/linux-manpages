.SH NAME
prb_read_valid_info \- Non-blocking read of meta data for a requested record or (if gone) the next available record.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "bool" prb_read_valid_info
.BI "(struct printk_ringbuffer *rb "  ","
.BI "u64 seq "  ","
.BI "struct printk_info *info "  ","
.BI "unsigned int *line_count "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "rb" 12
The ringbuffer to read from.
.IP "seq" 12
The sequence number of the record to read.
.IP "info" 12
A buffer to store the read record meta data to.
.IP "line_count" 12
A buffer to store the number of lines in the record text.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This is the public function available to readers to read only the
meta data of a record.

The reader provides the \fIinfo\fP, \fIline_count\fP buffers to be filled in.
Either of the buffer pointers can be set to NULL if the reader is not
interested in that data.

On success, the reader must check info->seq to see which record meta data
was actually read. This allows the reader to detect dropped records.

Failure means \fIseq\fP refers to a not yet written record.
.SH "CONTEXT"
Any context.
.SH "RETURN"
true if a record's meta data was read, otherwise false.
