.SH "DESCRIPTION"

The SSI has a limitation in that the samples must be in the same byte
order as the host CPU.  This is because when multiple bytes are written
to the STX register, the bytes and bits must be written in the same
order.  The STX is a shift register, so all the bits need to be aligned
(bit-endianness must match byte-endianness).  Processors typically write
the bits within a byte in the same order that the bytes of a word are
written in.  So if the host CPU is big-endian, then only big-endian
samples will be written to STX properly.
