.SH NAME
is_eva_access \- Find whether an instruction is an EVA memory accessor.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "bool" is_eva_access
.BI "(union mips_instruction inst "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "inst" 12
32-bit instruction encoding.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Finds whether \fIinst\fP encodes an EVA memory access instruction, which would
indicate that emulation of it should access the user mode address space
instead of the kernel mode address space. This matters for MUSUK segments
which are TLB mapped for user mode but unmapped for kernel mode.
.SH "RETURN"
Whether \fIinst\fP encodes an EVA accessor instruction.
