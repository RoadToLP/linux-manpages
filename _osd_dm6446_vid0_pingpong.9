_osd_dm6446_vid0_pingpong \- field inversion fix for DM6446
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" _osd_dm6446_vid0_pingpong
.BI "(struct osd_state *sd "  ","
.BI "int field_inversion "  ","
.BI "unsigned long fb_base_phys "  ","
.BI "const struct osd_layer_config *lconfig "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "sd" 12
ptr to struct osd_state
.IP "field_inversion" 12
inversion flag
.IP "fb_base_phys" 12
frame buffer address
.IP "lconfig" 12
ptr to layer config
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This routine implements a workaround for the field signal inversion silicon
erratum described in Advisory 1.3.8 for the DM6446.  The fb_base_phys and
lconfig parameters apply to the vid0 window.  This routine should be called
whenever the vid0 layer configuration or start address is modified, or when
the OSD field inversion setting is modified.
.SH "RETURN"
1 if the ping-pong buffers need to be toggled in the vsync isr, or
0 otherwise
