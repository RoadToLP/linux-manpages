.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" __register_blkdev
.BI "(unsigned int major "  ","
.BI "const char *name "  ","
.BI "void (*probe)(dev_t devt) "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "major" 12
the requested major device number [1..BLKDEV_MAJOR_MAX-1]. If
\fImajor\fP = 0, try to allocate any unused major number.
.IP "name" 12

.IP "probe" 12
allback that is called on access to any minor number of \fImajor\fP
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The \fIname\fP must be unique within the system.

The return value depends on the \fImajor\fP input parameter:

- if a major device number was requested in range [1..BLKDEV_MAJOR_MAX-1]
then the function returns zero on success, or a negative error code
- if any unused major number was requested with \fImajor\fP = 0 parameter
then the return value is the allocated major number in range
[1..BLKDEV_MAJOR_MAX-1] or a negative error code otherwise

See Documentation/admin-guide/devices.txt for the list of allocated
major numbers.

Use register_blkdev instead for any new code.
