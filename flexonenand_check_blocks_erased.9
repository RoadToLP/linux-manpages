.IP "start" 12

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Converting an unerased block from MLC to SLC
causes byte values to change. Since both data and its ECC
have changed, reads on the block give uncorrectable error.
This might lead to the block being detected as bad.

Avoid this by ensuring that the block to be converted is
erased.
