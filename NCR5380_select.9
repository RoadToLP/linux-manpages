.BI "(struct Scsi_Host *instance "  ","

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This routine establishes an I_T_L nexus for a SCSI command. This involves
ARBITRATION, SELECTION and MESSAGE OUT phases and an IDENTIFY message.

Returns true if the operation should be retried.
Returns false if it should not be retried.

Side effects :
If bus busy, arbitration failed, etc, \fBNCR5380_select\fP will exit
with registers as they should have been on entry - ie
SELECT_ENABLE will be set appropriately, the NCR5380
will cease to drive any SCSI bus signals.

If successful : the I_T_L nexus will be established, and
hostdata->connected will be set to cmd.
SELECT interrupt will be disabled.

If failed (no target) : cmd->\fBscsi_done\fP will be called, and the
cmd->result host byte set to DID_BAD_TARGET.
