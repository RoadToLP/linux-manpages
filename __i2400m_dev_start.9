.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Uploads firmware and brings up all the resources needed to be able
to communicate with the device.

The workqueue has to be setup early, at least before RX handling
(it's only real user for now) so it can process reports as they
arrive. We also want to destroy it if we retry, to make sure it is
flushed...easier like this.

TX needs to be setup before the bus-specific code (otherwise on
shutdown, the bus-tx code could try to access it).
