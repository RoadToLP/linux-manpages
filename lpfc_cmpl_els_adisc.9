.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This routine is the completion function for issuing the Address Discover
(ADISC) command. It first checks to see whether link went down during
the discovery process. If so, the node will be marked as node port
recovery for issuing discover IOCB by the link attention handler and
exit. Otherwise, the response status is checked. If error was reported
in the response status, the ADISC command shall be retried by invoking
the \fBlpfc_els_retry\fP routine. Otherwise, if no error was reported in
the response status, the state machine is invoked to set transition
with respect to NLP_EVT_CMPL_ADISC event.
