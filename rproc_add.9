.SH NAME
rproc_add \- register a remote processor
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" rproc_add
.BI "(struct rproc *rproc "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "rproc" 12
the remote processor handle to register
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Registers \fIrproc\fP with the remoteproc framework, after it has been
allocated with \fBrproc_alloc\fP.

This is called by the platform-specific rproc implementation, whenever
a new remote processor device is probed.

Returns 0 on success and an appropriate error code otherwise.

If found, those virtio devices will be created and added, so as a result
of registering this remote processor, additional virtio drivers might be
probed.
.SH "NOTE"
this function initiates an asynchronous firmware loading
context, which will look for virtio devices supported by the rproc's
firmware.
