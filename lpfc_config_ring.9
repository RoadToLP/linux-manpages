.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" lpfc_config_ring
.BI "(struct lpfc_hba * phba "  ","
.BI "int ring "  ","
.BI "LPFC_MBOXQ_t * pmb "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "phba" 12
pointer to lpfc hba data structure.
.IP "ring" 12
ring number/index
.IP "pmb" 12
pointer to the driver internal queue element for mailbox command.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The configure ring mailbox command is used to configure an IOCB ring. This
configuration binds from one to six of HBA RC_CTL/TYPE mask entries to the
ring. This is used to map incoming sequences to a particular ring whose
RC_CTL/TYPE mask entry matches that of the sequence. The driver should not
attempt to configure a ring whose number is greater than the number
specified in the Port Control Block (PCB). It is an error to issue the
configure ring command more than once with the same ring number. The HBA
returns an error if the driver attempts this.

This routine prepares the mailbox command for configuring IOCB ring.
