The NVM checksum is updated by calling the generic update_nvm_checksum,
which writes the checksum to the shadow ram.  The changes in the shadow
ram are then committed to the EEPROM by processing each bank at a time
checking for the modified bit and writing only the pending changes.
After a successful commit, the shadow ram is cleared and is ready for
future writes.
