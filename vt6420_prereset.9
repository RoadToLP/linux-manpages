SCR registers on vt6420 are pieces of shit and may hang the
whole machine completely if accessed with the wrong timing.
To avoid such catastrophe, vt6420 doesn't provide generic SCR
access operations, but uses SStatus and SControl only during
boot probing in controlled way.

As the old (pre EH update) probing code is proven to work, we
strictly follow the access pattern.

LOCKING:
Kernel thread context (may sleep)
.SH "RETURN"
0 on success, -errno otherwise.
