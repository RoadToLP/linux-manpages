The returned structure contains statistics of all objects
currently in use, ordered by following rules:
1) Root objects are always on lower indexes than the rest.
2) Objects with higher delta user count are always on lower
indexes.
3) In case multiple objects have the same delta user count,
the objects are ordered by user count.

Returns a pointer to stats instance in case of success,
otherwise it returns pointer error using ERR_PTR macro.
