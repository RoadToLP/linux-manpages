.SH NAME
dwc2_hsotg_write_fifo \- write packet Data to the TxFIFO
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" dwc2_hsotg_write_fifo
.BI "(struct dwc2_hsotg *hsotg "  ","
.BI "struct dwc2_hsotg_ep *hs_ep "  ","
.BI "struct dwc2_hsotg_req *hs_req "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "hsotg" 12
The controller state.
.IP "hs_ep" 12
The endpoint we're going to write for.
.IP "hs_req" 12
The request to write data for.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This is called when the TxFIFO has some space in it to hold a new
transmission and we have something to give it. The actual setup of
the data size is done elsewhere, so all we have to do is to actually
write the data.

The return value is zero if there is more space (or nothing was done)
otherwise -ENOSPC is returned if the FIFO space was used up.

This routine is only needed for PIO
