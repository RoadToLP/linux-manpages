argument structure
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Returns 0 on success or one of the following error codes:

-EINVAL:     Invalid arguments or mm or virtual address is in an invalid vma
(e.g., device file vma).
-ENOMEM:     Out of memory.
-EPERM:      Invalid permission (e.g., asking for write and range is read
only).
-EBUSY:      The range has been invalidated and the caller needs to wait for
the invalidation to finish.
-EFAULT:     A page was requested to be valid and could not be made valid
ie it has no backing VMA or it is illegal to access

This is similar to \fBget_user_pages\fP, except that it can read the page tables
without mutating them (ie causing faults).
