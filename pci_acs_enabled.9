.SH NAME
pci_acs_enabled \- test ACS against required flags for a given device
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "bool" pci_acs_enabled
.BI "(struct pci_dev *pdev "  ","
.BI "u16 acs_flags "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "pdev" 12
device to test
.IP "acs_flags" 12
required PCI ACS flags
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Return true if the device supports the provided flags.  Automatically
filters out flags that are not implemented on multifunction devices.

Note that this interface checks the effective ACS capabilities of the
device rather than the actual capabilities.  For instance, most single
function endpoints are not required to support ACS because they have no
opportunity for peer-to-peer access.  We therefore return 'true'
regardless of whether the device exposes an ACS capability.  This makes
it much easier for callers of this function to ignore the actual type
or topology of the device when testing ACS support.
