.SH NAME
zpool_has_pool \- Check if the pool driver is available
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "bool" zpool_has_pool
.BI "(char *type "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "type" 12
The type of the zpool to check (e.g. zbud, zsmalloc)
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This checks if the \fItype\fP pool driver is available.  This will try to load
the requested module, if needed, but there is no guarantee the module will
still be loaded and available immediately after calling.  If this returns
true, the caller should assume the pool is available, but must be prepared
to handle the \fI\fP\fBzpool_create_pool\fP returning failure.  However if this
returns false, the caller should assume the requested pool type is not
available; either the requested pool type module does not exist, or could
not be loaded, and calling \fI\fP\fBzpool_create_pool\fP with the pool type will
fail.

The \fItype\fP string must be null-terminated.
.SH "RETURN"
true if \fItype\fP pool is available, false if not
