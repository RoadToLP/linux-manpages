This routine marks a HBA's management interface as not blocked. Once the
HBA's management interface is marked as not blocked, all the user space
access to the HBA, whether they are from sysfs interface or libdfc
interface will be allowed. The HBA is set to block the management interface
when the driver prepares the HBA interface for online or offline and then
set to unblock the management interface afterwards.
