parallel port to deregister

When a parallel port driver is forcibly unloaded, or a
parallel port becomes inaccessible, the port driver must call
this function in order to deal with device drivers that still
want to use it.

The parport structure associated with the port has its
operations structure replaced with one containing 'null'
operations that return errors or just don't do anything.

Any drivers that have registered themselves using
\fBparport_register_driver\fP are notified that the port is no
longer accessible by having their \fBdetach\fP routines called
with \fIport\fP as the parameter.
