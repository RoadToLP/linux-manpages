.SH NAME
find_inode_by_ino_rcu \- Find an inode in the inode cache
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "struct inode *" find_inode_by_ino_rcu
.BI "(struct super_block *sb "  ","
.BI "unsigned long ino "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "sb" 12
Super block of file system to search
.IP "ino" 12
The inode number to match
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Search for the inode specified by \fIhashval\fP and \fIdata\fP in the inode cache,
where the helper function \fItest\fP will return 0 if the inode does not match
and 1 if it does.  The \fItest\fP function must be responsible for taking the
i_lock spin_lock and checking i_state for an inode being freed or being
initialized.

If successful, this will return the inode for which the \fItest\fP function
returned 1 and NULL otherwise.

The \fItest\fP function is not permitted to take a ref on any inode presented.
It is also not permitted to sleep.

The caller must hold the RCU read lock.
