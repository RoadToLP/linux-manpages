Command to issue
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Due to Hardware errata for IDENTIFY DEVICE command, the controller cannot
clear the BSY bit after receiving the PIO setup FIS. This results in the dma
state machine goes into the CMFatalErrorUpdate state and locks up. By
restarting the dma engine, it removes the controller out of lock up state.

Due to H/W errata, the controller is unable to save the PMP
field fetched from command header before sending the H2D FIS.
When the device returns the PMP port field in the D2H FIS, there is
a mismatch and results in command completion failure. The
workaround is to write the pmp value to PxFBS.DEV field before issuing
any command to PMP.
