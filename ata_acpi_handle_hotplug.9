.SH "DESCRIPTION"
All ACPI bay / device realted events end up in this function.  If
the event is port-wide \fIdev\fP is NULL.  If the event is specific to a
device, \fIdev\fP points to it.

Hotplug (as opposed to unplug) notification is always handled as
port-wide while unplug only kills the target device on device-wide
event.

LOCKING:
ACPI notify handler context.  May sleep.
