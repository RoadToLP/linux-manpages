the offload queue

Services an offload Tx queue by moving packets from its Pending Send
Queue to the Hardware TX ring.  The function starts and ends with the
Send Queue locked, but drops the lock while putting the skb at the
head of the Send Queue onto the Hardware TX Ring.  Dropping the lock
allows more skbs to be added to the Send Queue by other threads.
The packet being processed at the head of the Pending Send Queue is
left on the queue in case we experience DMA Mapping errors, etc.
and need to give up and restart later.

\fBservice_ofldq\fP can be thought of as a task which opportunistically
uses other threads execution contexts.  We use the Offload Queue
boolean "service_ofldq_running" to make sure that only one instance
is ever running at a time ...
