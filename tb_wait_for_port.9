.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Wait up to 1 second for a port to reach state TB_PORT_UP. If
wait_if_unplugged is set then we also wait if the port is in state
TB_PORT_UNPLUGGED (it takes a while for the device to be registered after
switch resume). Otherwise we only wait if a device is registered but the link
has not yet been established.
.SH "RETURN"
Returns an error code on failure. Returns 0 if the port is not
connected or failed to reach state TB_PORT_UP within one second. Returns 1
if the port is connected and in state TB_PORT_UP.
