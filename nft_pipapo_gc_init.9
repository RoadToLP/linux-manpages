.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Instead of actually setting up a periodic work for garbage collection, as
this operation requires a swap of matching data with the working copy, we'll
do that opportunistically with other commit operations if the interval is
elapsed, so we just need to set the current jiffies timestamp here.
