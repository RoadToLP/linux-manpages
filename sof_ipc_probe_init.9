.SH NAME
sof_ipc_probe_init \- initialize data probing
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" sof_ipc_probe_init
.BI "(struct snd_sof_dev *sdev "  ","
.BI "u32 stream_tag "  ","
.BI "size_t buffer_size "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "sdev" 12
SOF sound device
.IP "stream_tag" 12
Extractor stream tag
.IP "buffer_size" 12
DMA buffer size to set for extractor
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Host chooses whether extraction is supported or not by providing
valid stream tag to DSP. Once specified, stream described by that
tag will be tied to DSP for extraction for the entire lifetime of
probe.

Probing is initialized only once and each INIT request must be
matched by DEINIT call.
