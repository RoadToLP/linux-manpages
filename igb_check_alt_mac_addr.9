Checks the nvm for an alternate MAC address.  An alternate MAC address
can be setup by pre-boot software and must be treated like a permanent
address and must override the actual permanent MAC address.  If an
alternate MAC address is found it is saved in the hw struct and
programmed into RAR0 and the function returns success, otherwise the
function returns an error.
