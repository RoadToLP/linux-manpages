.SH "DESCRIPTION"
On insertion, elements are added to a copy of the matching data currently
in use for lookups, and not directly inserted into current lookup data, so
we'll take care of that by calling \fBpipapo_commit\fP here. Both
\fBnft_pipapo_insert\fP and \fBnft_pipapo_activate\fP are called once for each
element, hence we can't purpose either one as a real commit operation.
