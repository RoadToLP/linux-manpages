.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" i915_perf_disable_locked
.BI "(struct i915_perf_stream *stream "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "stream" 12
An enabled i915 perf stream
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Disables the associated capture of data for this stream.

The intention is that disabling an re-enabling a stream will ideally be
cheaper than destroying and re-opening a stream with the same configuration,
though there are no formal guarantees about what state or buffered data
must be retained between disabling and re-enabling a stream.
.SH "NOTE"
while a stream is disabled it's considered an error for userspace
to attempt to read from the stream (-EIO).
