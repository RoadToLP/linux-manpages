.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" dma_fence_signal_timestamp
.BI "(struct dma_fence *fence "  ","
.BI "ktime_t timestamp "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "fence" 12
the fence to signal
.IP "timestamp" 12
fence signal timestamp in kernel's CLOCK_MONOTONIC time domain
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Signal completion for software callbacks on a fence, this will unblock
\fBdma_fence_wait\fP calls and run all the callbacks added with
\fBdma_fence_add_callback\fP. Can be called multiple times, but since a fence
can only go from the unsignaled to the signaled state and not back, it will
only be effective the first time. Set the timestamp provided as the fence
signal timestamp.

Returns 0 on success and a negative error value when \fIfence\fP has been
signalled already.
