.SH NAME
debugfs_create_file_size \- create a file in the debugfs filesystem
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" debugfs_create_file_size
.BI "(const char *name "  ","
.BI "umode_t mode "  ","
.BI "struct dentry *parent "  ","
.BI "void *data "  ","
.BI "const struct file_operations *fops "  ","
.BI "loff_t file_size "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "name" 12
a pointer to a string containing the name of the file to create.
.IP "mode" 12
the permission that the file should have.
.IP "parent" 12
a pointer to the parent dentry for this file.  This should be a
directory dentry if set.  If this parameter is NULL, then the
file will be created in the root of the debugfs filesystem.
.IP "data" 12
a pointer to something that the caller will want to get to later
on.  The inode.i_private pointer will point to this value on
the \fBopen\fP call.
.IP "fops" 12
a pointer to a struct file_operations that should be used for
this file.
.IP "file_size" 12
initial file size
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This is the basic "create a file" function for debugfs.  It allows for a
wide range of flexibility in creating a file, or a directory (if you want
to create a directory, the \fBdebugfs_create_dir\fP function is
recommended to be used instead.)
