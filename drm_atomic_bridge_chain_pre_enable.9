.SH NAME
drm_atomic_bridge_chain_pre_enable \- prepares for enabling all bridges in the encoder chain
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" drm_atomic_bridge_chain_pre_enable
.BI "(struct drm_bridge *bridge "  ","
.BI "struct drm_atomic_state *old_state "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "bridge" 12
bridge control structure
.IP "old_state" 12
old atomic state
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Calls \fIdrm_bridge_funcs.atomic_pre_enable\fP (falls back on
\fIdrm_bridge_funcs.pre_enable\fP) op for all the bridges in the encoder chain,
starting from the last bridge to the first. These are called before calling
\fIdrm_encoder_helper_funcs.atomic_enable\fP
.SH "NOTE"
the bridge passed should be the one closest to the encoder
