.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Given the offload_handle sent by the VF, look for the related SA table
entry and use its xs field to call for a delete of the SA.

Returns 0 or error value
.SH "NOTE"
We silently ignore requests to delete entries that are already
set to unused because when a VF is set to "DOWN", the PF first
gets a reset and clears all the VF's entries; then the VF's
XFRM stack sends individual deletes for each entry, which the
reset already removed.  In the future it might be good to try to
optimize this so not so many unnecessary delete messages are sent.
