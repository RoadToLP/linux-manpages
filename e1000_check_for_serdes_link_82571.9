pointer to the HW structure

Reports the link state as up or down.

If autonegotiation is supported by the link partner, the link state is
determined by the result of autonegotiation. This is the most likely case.
If autonegotiation is not supported by the link partner, and the link
has a valid signal, force the link up.

The link state is represented internally here by 4 states:

1) down
2) autoneg_progress
3) autoneg_complete (the link successfully autonegotiated)
4) forced_up (the link has been forced up, it did not autonegotiate)
