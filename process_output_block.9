process_output_block \- block post processor
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "ssize_t" process_output_block
.BI "(struct tty_struct *tty "  ","
.BI "const unsigned char *buf "  ","
.BI "unsigned int nr "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "tty" 12
terminal device
.IP "buf" 12
character buffer
.IP "nr" 12
number of bytes to output

Output a block of characters with OPOST processing.
Returns the number of characters output.

This path is used to speed up block console writes, among other
things when processing blocks of output data. It handles only
the simple cases normally found and helps to generate blocks of
symbols for the console driver and thus improve performance.

Locking: output_lock to protect column state and space left
(also, this is called from n_tty_write under the
tty layer write lock)
