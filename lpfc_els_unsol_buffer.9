.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This routine is used for processing the IOCB associated with a unsolicited
event. It first determines whether there is an existing ndlp that matches
the DID from the unsolicited IOCB. If not, it will create a new one with
the DID from the unsolicited IOCB. The ELS command from the unsolicited
IOCB is then used to invoke the proper routine and to set up proper state
of the discovery state machine.
