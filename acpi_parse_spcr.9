.SH "DESCRIPTION"
For the architectures with support for ACPI, CONFIG_ACPI_SPCR_TABLE may be
defined to parse ACPI SPCR table.  As a result of the parsing preferred
console is registered and if \fIenable_earlycon\fP is true, earlycon is set up.
If \fIenable_console\fP is true the system console is also configured.

When CONFIG_ACPI_SPCR_TABLE is defined, this function should be called
from arch initialization code as soon as the DT/ACPI decision is made.
