.SH NAME
exynos5_dmc_target \- Function responsible for changing frequency of DMC
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" exynos5_dmc_target
.BI "(struct device *dev "  ","
.BI "unsigned long *freq "  ","
.BI "u32 flags "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dev" 12
device for which the frequency is going to be changed
.IP "freq" 12
requested frequency in KHz
.IP "flags" 12
flags provided for this frequency change request
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
An entry function provided to the devfreq framework which provides frequency
change of the DMC. The function gets the possible rate from OPP table based
on requested frequency. It calls the next function responsible for the
frequency and voltage change. In case of failure, does not set 'curr_rate'
and returns error value to the framework.
