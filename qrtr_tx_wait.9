The flow control scheme is based around the low and high "watermarks". When

message, which will trigger the remote to send a control message of the type
QRTR_TYPE_RESUME_TX to reset the counter. If the high watermark is hit
further transmision should be paused.
.SH "RETURN"
1 if confirm_rx should be set, 0 otherwise or errno failure
