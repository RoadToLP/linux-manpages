.SH NAME
zpool_evictable \- Test if zpool is potentially evictable
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "bool" zpool_evictable
.BI "(struct zpool *zpool "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "zpool" 12
The zpool to test
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Zpool is only potentially evictable when it's created with struct
zpool_ops.evict and its driver implements struct zpool_driver.shrink.

However, it doesn't necessarily mean driver will use zpool_ops.evict
in its implementation of zpool_driver.shrink. It could do internal
defragmentation instead.
.SH "RETURN"
true if potentially evictable; false otherwise.
