GPIO chip
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
ACPI5 platforms can use GPIO signaled ACPI events. These GPIO interrupts are
handled by ACPI event methods which need to be called from the GPIO
chip's interrupt handler. \fBacpi_gpiochip_request_interrupts\fP finds out which
GPIO pins have ACPI event methods and assigns interrupt handlers that calls
the ACPI event methods for those pins.
