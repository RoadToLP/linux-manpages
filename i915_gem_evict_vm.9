.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" i915_gem_evict_vm

.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "vm" 12
Address space to cleanse
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function evicts all vmas from a vm.

This is used by the execbuf code as a last-ditch effort to defragment the
address space.

To clarify: This is for freeing up virtual address space, not for freeing
memory in e.g. the shrinker.
