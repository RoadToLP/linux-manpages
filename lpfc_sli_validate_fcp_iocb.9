.IP "iocbq" 12
Pointer to driver iocb object.
.IP "vport" 12

LPFC_CTX_LUN/LPFC_CTX_TGT/LPFC_CTX_HOST
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function acts as an iocb filter for functions which abort or count
all FCP iocbs pending on a lun/SCSI target/SCSI host. It will return
0 if the filtering criteria is met for the given iocb and will return
1 if the filtering criteria is not met.
If ctx_cmd == LPFC_CTX_LUN, the function returns 0 only if the
given iocb is for the SCSI device specified by vport, tgt_id and
lun_id parameter.
If ctx_cmd == LPFC_CTX_TGT,  the function returns 0 only if the
given iocb is for the SCSI target specified by vport and tgt_id
parameters.
If ctx_cmd == LPFC_CTX_HOST, the function returns 0 only if the
given iocb is for the SCSI host associated with the given vport.
This function is called with no locks held.
