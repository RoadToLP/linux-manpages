.SH "DESCRIPTION"
For a filesystem that just pins its dentries in memory and never
performs lookups at all, return an unhashed IS_ROOT dentry.
This is used for pipes, sockets et.al. - the stuff that should
never be anyone's children or parents.  Unlike all other
dentries, these will not have RCU delay between dropping the
last reference and freeing them.

The only user is \fBalloc_file_pseudo\fP and that's what should
be considered a public interface.  Don't use directly.
