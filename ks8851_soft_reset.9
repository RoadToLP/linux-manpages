.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Issue the relevant soft-reset command to the device's GRR register
specified by \fIop\fP.

Note, the delays are in there as a caution to ensure that the reset
has time to take effect and then complete. Since the datasheet does
not currently specify the exact sequence, we have chosen something
that seems to work with our device.
