.SH NAME
arch_phys_wc_add \- add a WC MTRR and handle errors if PAT is unavailable
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" arch_phys_wc_add
.BI "(unsigned long base "  ","
.BI "unsigned long size "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "base" 12
Physical base address
.IP "size" 12
Size of region
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
If PAT is available, this does nothing.  If PAT is unavailable, it
attempts to add a WC MTRR covering size bytes starting at base and
logs an error if this fails.

The called should provide a power of two size on an equivalent
power of two boundary.

Drivers must store the return value to pass to mtrr_del_wc_if_needed,
but drivers should not try to interpret that return value.
