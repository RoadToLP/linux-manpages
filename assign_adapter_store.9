.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "ssize_t" assign_adapter_store
.BI "(struct device *dev "  ","
.BI "struct device_attribute *attr "  ","
.BI "const char *buf "  ","
.BI "size_t count "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dev" 12
the matrix device
.IP "attr" 12
the mediated matrix device's assign_adapter attribute
.IP "buf" 12
a buffer containing the AP adapter number (APID) to
be assigned
.IP "count" 12
the number of bytes in \fIbuf\fP
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Parses the APID from \fIbuf\fP and sets the corresponding bit in the mediated
matrix device's APM.

Returns the number of bytes processed if the APID is valid; otherwise,
returns one of the following errors:

1. -EINVAL
The APID is not a valid number

2. -ENODEV
The APID exceeds the maximum value configured for the system

3. -EADDRNOTAVAIL
An APQN derived from the cross product of the APID being assigned
and the APQIs previously assigned is not bound to the vfio_ap device
driver; or, if no APQIs have yet been assigned, the APID is not
contained in an APQN bound to the vfio_ap device driver.

4. -EADDRINUSE
An APQN derived from the cross product of the APID being assigned
and the APQIs previously assigned is being used by another mediated
matrix device
