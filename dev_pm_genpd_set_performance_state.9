.SH NAME
dev_pm_genpd_set_performance_state \- Set performance state of device's power domain.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" dev_pm_genpd_set_performance_state
.BI "(struct device *dev "  ","
.BI "unsigned int state "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dev" 12
Device for which the performance-state needs to be set.
.IP "state" 12
Target performance state of the device. This can be set as 0 when the
device doesn't have any performance state constraints left (And so
the device wouldn't participate anymore to find the target
performance state of the genpd).
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
It is assumed that the users guarantee that the genpd wouldn't be detached
while this routine is getting called.

Returns 0 on success and negative error values on failures.
