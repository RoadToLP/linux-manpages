.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function calculates and returns amount of dark space in an LEB which
has \fIspc\fP bytes of free and dirty space.

UBIFS is trying to account the space which might not be usable, and this
space is called "dark space". For example, if an LEB has only 512 free
bytes, it is dark space, because it cannot fit a large data node.
