.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function sends a default configuration MIB to the FW.

If this function errors out at any point, the driver is still able to
function.  The main impact is that LFC may not operate as expected.
Therefore an error state in this function should be treated with a DBG
message and continue on with driver rebuild/reenable.
