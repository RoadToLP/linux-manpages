.SH "DESCRIPTION"
If inode has a hashed alias, or is a directory and has any alias,
acquire the reference to alias and return it. Otherwise return NULL.
Notice that if inode is a directory there can be only one alias and
it can be unhashed only if it has no children, or if it is the root
of a filesystem, or if the directory was renamed and d_revalidate
was the first vfs operation to notice.

If the inode has an IS_ROOT, DCACHE_DISCONNECTED alias, then prefer
any other hashed alias over that one.
