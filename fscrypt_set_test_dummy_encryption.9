.SH NAME
fscrypt_set_test_dummy_encryption \- handle '-o test_dummy_encryption'
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" fscrypt_set_test_dummy_encryption
.BI "(struct super_block *sb "  ","
.BI "const char *arg "  ","
.BI "struct fscrypt_dummy_policy *dummy_policy "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "sb" 12
the filesystem on which test_dummy_encryption is being specified
.IP "arg" 12
the argument to the test_dummy_encryption option.  May be NULL.
.IP "dummy_policy" 12
the filesystem's current dummy policy (input/output, see
below)
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Handle the test_dummy_encryption mount option by creating a dummy encryption
policy, saving it in \fIdummy_policy\fP, and adding the corresponding dummy
encryption key to the filesystem.  If the \fIdummy_policy\fP is already set, then
instead validate that it matches \fIarg\fP.  Don't support changing it via
remount, as that is difficult to do safely.
.SH "RETURN"
0 on success (dummy policy set, or the same policy is already set);
-EEXIST if a different dummy policy is already set;
or another -errno value.
