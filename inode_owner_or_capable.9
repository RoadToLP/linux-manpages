.SH NAME
inode_owner_or_capable \- check current task permissions to inode
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "bool" inode_owner_or_capable
.BI "(struct user_namespace *mnt_userns "  ","
.BI "const struct inode *inode "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "mnt_userns" 12
user namespace of the mount the inode was found from
.IP "inode" 12
inode being checked
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Return true if current either has CAP_FOWNER in a namespace with the
inode owner uid mapped, or owns the file.

If the inode has been found through an idmapped mount the user namespace of
the vfsmount must be passed through \fImnt_userns\fP. This function will then take
care to map the inode according to \fImnt_userns\fP before checking permissions.
On non-idmapped mounts or if permission checking is to be performed on the
raw inode simply passs init_user_ns.
