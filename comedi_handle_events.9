.SH NAME
comedi_handle_events \- Handle events and possibly stop acquisition
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "unsigned int" comedi_handle_events
.BI "(struct comedi_device *dev "  ","
.BI "struct comedi_subdevice *s "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dev" 12
COMEDI device.
.IP "s" 12
COMEDI subdevice.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Handles outstanding asynchronous acquisition event flags associated
with the subdevice.  Call the subdevice's \fIs\fP->\fBcancel\fP handler if the
"end of acquisition", "error" or "overflow" event flags are set in order
to stop the acquisition at the driver level.

Calls \fBcomedi_event\fP to further process the event flags, which may mark
the asynchronous command as no longer running, possibly terminated with
an error, and may wake up tasks.

Return a bit-mask of the handled events.
