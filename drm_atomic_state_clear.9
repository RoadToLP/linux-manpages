atomic state
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
When the w/w mutex algorithm detects a deadlock we need to back off and drop
all locks. So someone else could sneak in and change the current modeset
configuration. Which means that all the state assembled in \fIstate\fP is no
longer an atomic update to the current state, but to some arbitrary earlier
state. Which could break assumptions the driver's
\fIdrm_mode_config_funcs.atomic_check\fP likely relies on.

Hence we must clear all cached state and completely start over, using this
function.
