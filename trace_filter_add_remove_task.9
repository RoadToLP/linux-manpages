If adding a task, if \fIself\fP is defined, the task is only added if \fIself\fP
is also included in \fIpid_list\fP. This happens on fork and tasks should
only be added when the parent is listed. If \fIself\fP is NULL, then the
\fItask\fP pid will be removed from the list, which would happen on exit
of a task.
