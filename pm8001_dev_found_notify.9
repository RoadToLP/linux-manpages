the device structure which sas layer used.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
when libsas find a sas domain device, it should tell the LLDD that
device is found, and then LLDD register this device to HBA firmware
by the command "OPC_INB_REG_DEV", after that the HBA will assign a
device ID(according to device's sas address) and returned it to LLDD. From
now on, we communicate with HBA FW with the device ID which HBA assigned
rather than sas address. it is the necessary step for our HBA but it is
the optional for other HBA driver.
