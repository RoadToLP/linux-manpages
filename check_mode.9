.SH NAME
check_mode \- Verify if tuner supports the requested mode
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" check_mode
.BI "(struct tuner *t "  ","
.BI "enum v4l2_tuner_type mode "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "t" 12
a pointer to the module's internal struct_tuner
.IP "mode" 12
mode of the tuner, as defined by \fIenum v4l2_tuner_type\fP.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function checks if the tuner is capable of tuning analog TV,
digital TV or radio, depending on what the caller wants. If the
tuner can't support that mode, it returns -EINVAL. Otherwise, it
returns 0.
This function is needed for boards that have a separate tuner for
radio (like devices with tea5767).
.SH "NOTE"
mt20xx uses V4L2_TUNER_DIGITAL_TV and calls set_tv_freq to
select a TV frequency. So, t_mode = T_ANALOG_TV could actually
be used to represent a Digital TV too.
