.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" ice_flow_set_fld
.BI "(struct ice_flow_seg_info *seg "  ","
.BI "enum ice_flow_field fld "  ","
.BI "u16 val_loc "  ","

.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "seg" 12
packet segment the field being set belongs to
.IP "fld" 12
field to be set
.IP "val_loc" 12
if not ICE_FLOW_FLD_OFF_INVAL, location of the value to match from
entry's input buffer
.IP "mask_loc" 12
if not ICE_FLOW_FLD_OFF_INVAL, location of mask value from entry's
input buffer
.IP "last_loc" 12
if not ICE_FLOW_FLD_OFF_INVAL, location of last/upper value from
entry's input buffer
.IP "range" 12
indicate if field being matched is to be in a range
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function specifies the locations, in the form of byte offsets from the
start of the input buffer for a flow entry, from where the value to match,
the mask value, and upper value can be extracted. These locations are then
stored in the flow profile. When adding a flow entry associated with the
flow profile, these locations will be used to quickly extract the values and
create the content of a match entry. This function should only be used for
fixed-size data structures.
