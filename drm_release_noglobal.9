This function may be used by drivers as their \fIfile_operations.release\fP

the drm_global_mutex, which then calls the \fIdrm_driver.postclose\fP driver
callback. If this is the last open file for the DRM device also proceeds to
call the \fIdrm_driver.lastclose\fP driver callback.

Always succeeds and returns 0.
