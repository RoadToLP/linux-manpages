.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Issue a reset sequence to the NCR5380 and try and get the bus
back into sane shape.

This clears the reset interrupt flag because there may be no handler for
it. When the driver is initialized, the \fBNCR5380_intr\fP handler has not yet
been installed. And when in EH we may have released the ST DMA interrupt.
