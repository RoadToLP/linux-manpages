.SH NAME
cgroup_rstat_cpu_pop_updated \- iterate and dismantle rstat_cpu updated tree
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "struct cgroup *" cgroup_rstat_cpu_pop_updated
.BI "(struct cgroup *pos "  ","
.BI "struct cgroup *root "  ","
.BI "int cpu "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "pos" 12
current position
.IP "root" 12
root of the tree to traversal
.IP "cpu" 12
target cpu
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Walks the udpated rstat_cpu tree on \fIcpu\fP from \fIroot\fP.  NULL \fIpos\fP starts
the traversal and NULL return indicates the end.  During traversal,
each returned cgroup is unlinked from the tree.  Must be called with the
matching cgroup_rstat_cpu_lock held.

The only ordering guarantee is that, for a parent and a child pair
covered by a given traversal, if a child is visited, its parent is
guaranteed to be visited afterwards.
