.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "adap" 12
the adapter
.IP "qs" 12
the queue set owning the response queue
.IP "r" 12
the first pure response to process

A simpler version of \fBprocess_responses\fP that handles only pure (i.e.,
non data-carrying) responses.  Such respones are too light-weight to
justify calling a softirq under NAPI, so we handle them specially in
the interrupt handler.  The function is called with a pointer to a
response, which the caller must ensure is a valid pure response.

Returns 1 if it encounters a valid data-carrying response, 0 otherwise.
