.SH NAME
tty_termios_encode_baud_rate \- 
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" tty_termios_encode_baud_rate
.BI "(struct ktermios *termios "  ","
.BI "speed_t ibaud "  ","
.BI "speed_t obaud "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "termios" 12
ktermios structure holding user requested state
.IP "ibaud" 12
input speed
.IP "obaud" 12
output speed

Encode the speeds set into the passed termios structure. This is
used as a library helper for drivers so that they can report back
the actual speed selected when it differs from the speed requested

For maximal back compatibility with legacy SYS5/POSIX *nix behaviour
we need to carefully set the bits when the user does not get the
desired speed. We allow small margins and preserve as much of possible
of the input intent to keep compatibility.

Locking: Caller should hold termios lock. This is already held
when calling this function from the driver termios handler.

The ifdefs deal with platforms whose owners have yet to update them
and will all go away once this is done.
