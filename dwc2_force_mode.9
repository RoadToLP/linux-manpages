.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Forcing the mode is needed for two cases:

1) If the dr_mode is set to either HOST or PERIPHERAL we force the
controller to stay in a particular mode regardless of ID pin
changes. We do this once during probe.

2) During probe we want to read reset values of the hw
configuration registers that are only available in either host or
device mode. We may need to force the mode if the current mode does
not allow us to access the register in the mode that we want.

In either case it only makes sense to force the mode if the
controller hardware is OTG capable.

Checks are done in this function to determine whether doing a force
would be valid or not.

If a force is done, it requires a IDDIG debounce filter delay if
the filter is configured and enabled. We poll the current mode of
the controller to account for this delay.
