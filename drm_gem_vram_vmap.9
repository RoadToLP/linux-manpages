.SH NAME
drm_gem_vram_vmap \- Pins and maps a GEM VRAM object into kernel address space
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" drm_gem_vram_vmap
.BI "(struct drm_gem_vram_object *gbo "  ","
.BI "struct dma_buf_map *map "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gbo" 12
The GEM VRAM object to map
.IP "map" 12
Returns the kernel virtual address of the VRAM GEM object's backing
store.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The vmap function pins a GEM VRAM object to its current location, either
system or video memory, and maps its buffer into kernel address space.
As pinned object cannot be relocated, you should avoid pinning objects
permanently. Call \fBdrm_gem_vram_vunmap\fP with the returned address to
unmap and unpin the GEM VRAM object.
.SH "RETURN"
0 on success, or a negative error code otherwise.
