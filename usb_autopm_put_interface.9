.SH NAME
usb_autopm_put_interface \- decrement a USB interface's PM-usage counter
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" usb_autopm_put_interface
.BI "(struct usb_interface *intf "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "intf" 12
the usb_interface whose counter should be decremented
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This routine should be called by an interface driver when it is
finished using \fIintf\fP and wants to allow it to autosuspend.  A typical
example would be a character-device driver when its device file is
closed.

The routine decrements \fIintf\fP's usage counter.  When the counter reaches
0, a delayed autosuspend request for \fIintf\fP's device is attempted.  The
attempt may fail (see \fBautosuspend_check\fP).

This routine can run only in process context.
