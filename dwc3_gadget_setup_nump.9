.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The following looks like complex but it's actually very simple. In order to
calculate the number of packets we can burst at once on OUT transfers, we're
gonna use RxFIFO size.

To calculate RxFIFO size we need two numbers:
MDWIDTH = size, in bits, of the internal memory bus
RAM2_DEPTH = depth, in MDWIDTH, of internal RAM2 (where RxFIFO sits)

Given these two numbers, the formula is simple:

RxFIFO Size = (RAM2_DEPTH * MDWIDTH / 8) - 24 - 16;

24 bytes is for 3x SETUP packets
16 bytes is a clock domain crossing tolerance

Given RxFIFO Size, NUMP = RxFIFOSize / 1024;
