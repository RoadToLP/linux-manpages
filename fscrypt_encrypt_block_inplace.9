.SH NAME
fscrypt_encrypt_block_inplace \- Encrypt a filesystem block in-place
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" fscrypt_encrypt_block_inplace
.BI "(const struct inode *inode "  ","
.BI "struct page *page "  ","
.BI "unsigned int len "  ","
.BI "unsigned int offs "  ","
.BI "u64 lblk_num "  ","
.BI "gfp_t gfp_flags "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "inode" 12
The inode to which this block belongs
.IP "page" 12
The page containing the block to encrypt
.IP "len" 12
Size of block to encrypt.  Doesn't need to be a multiple of the
fs block size, but must be a multiple of FS_CRYPTO_BLOCK_SIZE.
.IP "offs" 12
Byte offset within \fIpage\fP at which the block to encrypt begins
.IP "lblk_num" 12
Filesystem logical block number of the block, i.e. the 0-based
number of the block within the file
.IP "gfp_flags" 12
Memory allocation flags
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Encrypt a possibly-compressed filesystem block that is located in an
arbitrary page, not necessarily in the original pagecache page.  The \fIinode\fP
and \fIlblk_num\fP must be specified, as they can't be determined from \fIpage\fP.
.SH "RETURN"
0 on success; -errno on failure
