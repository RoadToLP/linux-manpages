.SH "DESCRIPTION"
During TMF a task has to be checked if it's affected.
All unrelated I/O can be passed through, but I/O to the
affected LUN should be restricted.
If 'fast_abort' is set we won't be sending any I/O to the
affected LUN.
Otherwise the target is waiting for all TTTs to be completed,
so we have to send all outstanding Data-Out PDUs to the target.
