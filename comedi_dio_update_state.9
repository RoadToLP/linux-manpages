.SH NAME
comedi_dio_update_state \- Update the internal state of DIO subdevices
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "unsigned int" comedi_dio_update_state
.BI "(struct comedi_subdevice *s "  ","
.BI "unsigned int *data "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "s" 12
COMEDI subdevice.
.IP "data" 12
The channel mask and bits to update.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Updates \fIs->state\fP which holds the internal state of the outputs for DIO
or DO subdevices (up to 32 channels).  \fIdata\fP[0] contains a bit-mask of
the channels to be updated.  \fIdata\fP[1] contains a bit-mask of those
channels to be set to '1'.  The caller is responsible for updating the
outputs in hardware according to \fIs->state\fP.  As a minimum, the channels
in the returned bit-mask need to be updated.

Returns \fImask\fP with non-existent channels removed.
