ath5k_hw_rf_check_gainf_readback \- Validate Gain_F feedback from detector
.SH SYNOPSIS

.BI "(struct ath5k_hw *ah "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "ah" 12
The \fIstruct ath5k_hw\fP
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Check if current gain_F measurement is in the range of our
power detector windows. If we get a measurement outside range
we know it's not accurate (detectors can't measure anything outside
their detection window) so we must ignore it.

Returns true if readback was O.K. or false on failure
