snd_hdac_i915_set_bclk \- Reprogram BCLK for HSW/BDW
.SH SYNOPSIS

.BI "(struct hdac_bus *bus "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "bus" 12
HDA core bus
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Intel HSW/BDW display HDA controller is in GPU. Both its power and link BCLK
depends on GPU. Two Extended Mode registers EM4 (M value) and EM5 (N Value)
are used to convert CDClk (Core Display Clock) to 24MHz BCLK:
BCLK = CDCLK * M / N
The values will be lost when the display power well is disabled and need to
be restored to avoid abnormal playback speed.

Call this function at initializing and changing power well, as well as
at ELD notifier for the hotplug.
