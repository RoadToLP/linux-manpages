.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This routine releases the lpfc DMA (Direct Memory Access) buffer(s)
associated with a command IOCB back to the lpfc DMA buffer pool. It first
checks to see whether there is a lpfc DMA buffer associated with the
response of the command IOCB. If so, it will be released before releasing
the lpfc DMA buffer associated with the IOCB itself.

Return code
0 - Successfully released lpfc DMA buffer (currently, always return 0)
