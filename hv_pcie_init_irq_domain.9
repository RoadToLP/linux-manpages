.SH NAME
hv_pcie_init_irq_domain \- Initialize IRQ domain
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" hv_pcie_init_irq_domain
.BI "(struct hv_pcibus_device *hbus "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "hbus" 12
The root PCI bus
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function creates an IRQ domain which will be used for
interrupts from devices that have been passed through.  These
devices only support MSI and MSI-X, not line-based interrupts
or simulations of line-based interrupts through PCIe's
fabric-layer messages.  Because interrupts are remapped, we
can support multi-message MSI here.
.SH "RETURN"
'0' on success and error value on failure
