.SH NAME
asd_update_port_links \- - update port_map_by_links and phy_is_up
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" asd_update_port_links
.BI "(struct asd_ha_struct *asd_ha "  ","
.BI "struct asd_phy *phy "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "asd_ha" 12
pointer to host adapter structure
.IP "phy" 12
pointer to the phy which has been added to a port
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
1) When a link reset has completed and we got BYTES DMAED with a
valid frame we call this function for that phy, to indicate that
the phy is up, i.e. we update the phy_is_up in DDB 0.  The
sequencer checks phy_is_up when pending SCBs are to be sent, and
when an open address frame has been received.

2) When we know of ports, we call this function to update the map
of phys participaing in that port, i.e. we update the
port_map_by_links in DDB 0.  When a HARD_RESET primitive has been
received, the sequencer disables all phys in that port.
port_map_by_links is also used as the conn_mask byte in the
initiator/target port DDB.
