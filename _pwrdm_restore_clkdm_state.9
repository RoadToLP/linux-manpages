.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Restore the clockdomain state perturbed by
\fB_pwrdm_save_clkdm_state_and_activate\fP, and call the power state
bookkeeping code.  Called by \fBomap_set_pwrdm_state\fP.  NOTE that if
the powerdomain contains multiple clockdomains, this assumes that
the first associated clockdomain supports either
hardware-supervised idle control in the register, or
software-supervised sleep.  No return value.
