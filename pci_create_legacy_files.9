.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" pci_create_legacy_files
.BI "(struct pci_bus *b "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "b" 12
bus to create files under
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Some platforms allow access to legacy I/O port and ISA memory space on
a per-bus basis.  This routine creates the files and ties them into
their associated read, write and mmap files from pci-sysfs.c

On error unwind, but don't propagate the error to the caller
as it is ok to set up the PCI bus without these files.
