.SH NAME
devm_fpga_bridge_create \- create and init a managed struct fpga_bridge
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "struct fpga_bridge *" devm_fpga_bridge_create
.BI "(struct device *dev "  ","
.BI "const char *name "  ","
.BI "const struct fpga_bridge_ops *br_ops "  ","
.BI "void *priv "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dev" 12
FPGA bridge device from pdev
.IP "name" 12
FPGA bridge name
.IP "br_ops" 12
pointer to structure of fpga bridge ops
.IP "priv" 12
FPGA bridge private data
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function is intended for use in a FPGA bridge driver's probe function.
After the bridge driver creates the struct with \fBdevm_fpga_bridge_create\fP, it
should register the bridge with \fBfpga_bridge_register\fP.  The bridge driver's
remove function should call \fBfpga_bridge_unregister\fP.  The bridge struct
allocated with this function will be freed automatically on driver detach.
This includes the case of a probe function returning error before calling
\fBfpga_bridge_register\fP, the struct will still get cleaned up.
.SH "RETURN"
struct fpga_bridge or NULL
