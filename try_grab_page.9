.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "bool" try_grab_page
.BI "(struct page *page "  ","
.BI "unsigned int flags "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "page" 12
pointer to page to be grabbed
.IP "flags" 12
gup flags: these are the FOLL_* flag values.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

This might not do anything at all, depending on the flags argument.

"grab" names in this file mean, "look at flags to decide whether to use
FOLL_PIN or FOLL_GET behavior, when incrementing the page's refcount.

Either FOLL_PIN or FOLL_GET (or neither) may be set, but not both at the same
time. Cases:

FOLL_GET: page's refcount will be incremented by 1.
FOLL_PIN: page's refcount will be incremented by GUP_PIN_COUNTING_BIAS.
.SH "RETURN"
true for success, or if no action was required (if neither FOLL_PIN
nor FOLL_GET was set, nothing is done). False for failure: FOLL_GET or
FOLL_PIN was set, but the page could not be grabbed.
