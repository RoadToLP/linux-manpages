.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The state machine handling concept in this module is to check every tick
which state machine should operate any function. The execution order is
round robin, so when we have an interaction between state machines, the
reply of one to each other might be delayed until next tick.

This function also complete the initialization when the agg_select_timer
times out, and it selects an aggregator for the ports that are yet not
related to any aggregator, and selects the active aggregator for a bond.
