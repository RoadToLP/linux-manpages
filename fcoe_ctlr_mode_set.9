.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Note that the we shouldn't be changing the libfc discovery settings
(fc_disc_config) while an lport is going through the libfc state
machine. The mode can only be changed when a fcoe_ctlr device is
disabled, so that should ensure that this routine is only called
when nothing is happening.
