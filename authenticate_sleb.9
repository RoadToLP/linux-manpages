.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function iterates over the buds of a single LEB authenticating all buds
with the authentication nodes on this LEB. Authentication nodes are written
after some buds and contain a HMAC covering the authentication node itself
and the buds between the last authentication node and the current
authentication node. It can happen that the last buds cannot be authenticated
because a powercut happened when some nodes were written but not the
corresponding authentication node. This function returns the number of nodes
that could be authenticated or a negative error code.
