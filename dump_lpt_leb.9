.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function dumps an LEB from LPT area. Nodes in this area are very
different to nodes in the main area (e.g., they do not have common headers,
they do not have 8-byte alignments, etc), so we have a separate function to
dump LPT area LEBs. Note, LPT has to be locked by the caller.
