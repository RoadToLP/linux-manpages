Allocate the frame buffer. In the usual case we get a GTT range that
is stolen memory backed and life is simple. If there isn't sufficient
we fail as we don't have the virtual mapping space to really vmap it
and the kernel console code can't handle non linear framebuffers.

Re-address this as and if the framebuffer layer grows this ability.
