.SH NAME
i810_calc_dclk \- calculates the P, M, and N values of a pixelclock value
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" i810_calc_dclk
.BI "(u32 freq "  ","
.BI "u32 *m "  ","
.BI "u32 *n "  ","
.BI "u32 *p "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "freq" 12
target pixelclock in picoseconds
.IP "m" 12
where to write M register
.IP "n" 12
where to write N register
.IP "p" 12
where to write P register
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Based on the formula Freq_actual = (4*M*Freq_ref)/(N^P)
Repeatedly computes the Freq until the actual Freq is equal to
the target Freq or until the loop count is zero.  In the latter
case, the actual frequency nearest the target will be used.
