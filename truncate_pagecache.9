.SH NAME
truncate_pagecache \- unmap and remove pagecache that has been truncated
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" truncate_pagecache
.BI "(struct inode *inode "  ","
.BI "loff_t newsize "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "inode" 12
inode
.IP "newsize" 12
new file size
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
inode's new i_size must already be written before truncate_pagecache
is called.

This function should typically be called before the filesystem
releases resources associated with the freed range (eg. deallocates
blocks). This way, pagecache will always stay logically coherent
with on-disk format, and the filesystem would not have to deal with
situations such as writepage being called for a page that has already
had its underlying blocks deallocated.
