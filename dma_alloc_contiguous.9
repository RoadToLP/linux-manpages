.SH NAME
dma_alloc_contiguous \- allocate contiguous pages
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "struct page *" dma_alloc_contiguous
.BI "(struct device *dev "  ","
.BI "size_t size "  ","
.BI "gfp_t gfp "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dev" 12
Pointer to device for which the allocation is performed.
.IP "size" 12
Requested allocation size.
.IP "gfp" 12
Allocation flags.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
tries to use device specific contiguous memory area if available, or it
tries to use per-numa cma, if the allocation fails, it will fallback to
try default global one.

Note that it bypass one-page size of allocations from the per-numa and
global area as the addresses within one page are always contiguous, so
there is no need to waste CMA pages for that kind; it also helps reduce
fragmentations.
