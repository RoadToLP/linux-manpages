.SH NAME
scsi_report_lun_scan \- Scan using SCSI REPORT LUN results
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" scsi_report_lun_scan
.BI "(struct scsi_target *starget "  ","
.BI "blist_flags_t bflags "  ","
.BI "enum scsi_scan_mode rescan "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "starget" 12
which target
.IP "bflags" 12
Zero or a mix of BLIST_NOLUN, BLIST_REPORTLUN2, or BLIST_NOREPORTLUN
.IP "rescan" 12
nonzero if we can skip code only needed on first scan
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Fast scanning for modern (SCSI-3) devices by sending a REPORT LUN command.
Scan the resulting list of LUNs by calling scsi_probe_and_add_lun.

If BLINK_REPORTLUN2 is set, scan a target that supports more than 8
LUNs even if it's older than SCSI-3.
If BLIST_NOREPORTLUN is set, return 1 always.
If BLIST_NOLUN is set, return 0 always.
If starget->no_report_luns is set, return 1 always.
.SH "RETURN"
0: scan completed (or no memory, so further scanning is futile)
1: could not scan with REPORT LUN
