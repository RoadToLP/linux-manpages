.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function is called by the low level machine check code
of an architecture when it detects hardware memory corruption
of a page. It tries its best to recover, which includes
dropping pages, killing processes etc.

The function is primarily of use for corruptions that
happen outside the current execution context (e.g. when
detected by a background scrubber)

Must run in process context (e.g. a work queue) with interrupts
enabled and no spinlocks hold.
