.SH "DESCRIPTION"
There are some devices with an optimization that enables the device to not
require loading firmware on system reboot. This optimization may still
require the firmware present on resume from suspend. This routine can be
used to ensure the firmware is present on resume from suspend in these
situations. This helper is not compatible with drivers which use
\fBrequest_firmware_into_buf\fP or \fBrequest_firmware_nowait\fP with no uevent set.
