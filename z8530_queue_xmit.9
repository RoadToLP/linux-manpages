z8530_queue_xmit \- Queue a packet
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "netdev_tx_t" z8530_queue_xmit

.BI "struct sk_buff *skb "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "c" 12
The channel to use
.IP "skb" 12
The packet to kick down the channel

Queue a packet for transmission. Because we have rather
hard to hit interrupt latencies for the Z85230 per packet 
even in DMA mode we do the flip to DMA buffer if needed here
not in the IRQ.

Called from the network code. The lock is not held at this 
point.
