.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Restore the PTP hardware clock registers. We previously cached the PTP
hardware time as pf->ptp_prev_hw_time. To be as accurate as possible,
update this value based on the time delta since the time was saved, using
CLOCK_MONOTONIC (via \fBktime_get\fP) to calculate the time difference.

This ensures that the hardware clock is restored to nearly what it should
have been if a reset had not occurred.
