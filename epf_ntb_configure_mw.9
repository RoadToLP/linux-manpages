PCI Address Space
(Managed by HOST2)

This function performs stage (B) in the above diagram (see MW1) i.e., map OB
address space of memory window to PCI address space.

This operation requires 3 parameters
1) Address in the outbound address space
2) Address in the PCI Address space
3) Size of the address region to be mapped

The address in the outbound address space (for MW1, MW2, MW3 and MW4) is
stored in epf_bar corresponding to BAR_DB_MW1 for MW1 and BAR_MW2, BAR_MW3
BAR_MW4 for rest of the BARs of epf_ntb_epc that is connected to HOST1. This
is populated in \fBepf_ntb_alloc_peer_mem\fP in this driver.

The address and size of the PCI address region that has to be mapped would
be provided by HOST2 in ctrl->addr and ctrl->size of epf_ntb_epc that is
connected to HOST2.

Please note Memory window1 (MW1) and Doorbell registers together will be
mapped to a single BAR (BAR2) above for 32-bit BARs. The exact BAR that's
used for Memory window (MW) can be obtained from epf_ntb_bar[BAR_DB_MW1],
epf_ntb_bar[BAR_MW2], epf_ntb_bar[BAR_MW2], epf_ntb_bar[BAR_MW2].
