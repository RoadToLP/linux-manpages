.SH NAME
kvm_vgic_addr \- set or get vgic VM base addresses
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" kvm_vgic_addr
.BI "(struct kvm *kvm "  ","
.BI "unsigned long type "  ","
.BI "u64 *addr "  ","
.BI "bool write "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "kvm" 12
pointer to the vm struct
.IP "type" 12
the VGIC addr type, one of KVM_VGIC_V[23]_ADDR_TYPE_XXX
.IP "addr" 12
pointer to address value
.IP "write" 12
if true set the address in the VM address space, if false read the
address
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Set or get the vgic base addresses for the distributor and the virtual CPU
interface in the VM physical address space.  These addresses are properties
of the emulated core/SoC and therefore user space initially knows this
information.
Check them for sanity (alignment, double assignment). We can't check for
overlapping regions in case of a virtual GICv3 here, since we don't know
the number of VCPUs yet, so we defer this check to \fBmap_resources\fP.
