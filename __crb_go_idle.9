.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Write CRB_CTRL_REQ_GO_IDLE to TPM_CRB_CTRL_REQ
The device should respond within TIMEOUT_C by clearing the bit.
Anyhow, we do not wait here as a consequent CMD_READY request
will be handled correctly even if idle was not completed.

The function does nothing for devices with ACPI-start method
or SMC-start method.
.SH "RETURN"
0 always
