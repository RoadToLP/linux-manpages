.SH NAME
dma_buf_map_attachment \- Returns the scatterlist table of the attachment; mapped into _device_ address space. Is a wrapper for map_dma_buf() of the dma_buf_ops.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "struct sg_table *" dma_buf_map_attachment
.BI "(struct dma_buf_attachment *attach "  ","
.BI "enum dma_data_direction direction "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "attach" 12
[in]    attachment whose scatterlist is to be returned
.IP "direction" 12
[in]    direction of DMA transfer
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Returns sg_table containing the scatterlist to be returned; returns ERR_PTR
on error. May return -EINTR if it is interrupted by a signal.

On success, the DMA addresses and lengths in the returned scatterlist are
PAGE_SIZE aligned.

A mapping must be unmapped by using \fBdma_buf_unmap_attachment\fP. Note that
the underlying backing storage is pinned for as long as a mapping exists,
therefore users/importers should not hold onto a mapping for undue amounts of
time.
