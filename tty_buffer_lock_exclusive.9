tty port owning the flip buffer

Guarantees safe use of the line discipline's \fBreceive_buf\fP method by
excluding the buffer work and any pending flush from using the flip
buffer. Data can continue to be added concurrently to the flip buffer
from the driver side.

On release, the buffer work is restarted if there is data in the
flip buffer
