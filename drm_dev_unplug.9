DRM device
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This unplugs a hotpluggable DRM device, which makes it inaccessible to
userspace operations. Entry-points can use \fBdrm_dev_enter\fP and
\fBdrm_dev_exit\fP to protect device resources in a race free manner. This
essentially unregisters the device like \fBdrm_dev_unregister\fP, but can be
called while there are still open users of \fIdev\fP.
