.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dev_priv" 12
driver private
.IP "mask" 12

.SH "NOTE"
the HPD enable bits are modified both inside and outside
of an interrupt context. To avoid that read-modify-write cycles
interfer, these bits are protected by a spinlock. Since this
function is usually not called from a context where the lock is
held already, this function acquires the lock itself. A non-locking
version is also available.
