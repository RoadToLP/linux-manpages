.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function performs all that is necessary to disable an
IOMMU device, either during final detachment from a client
device, or during system/runtime suspend of the device. This
includes programming all the appropriate IOMMU registers, and
managing the associated omap_hwmod's state and the device's
reset line. This function also saves the context of any
locked TLBs if suspending.
