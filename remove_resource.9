.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Returns 0 on success, -EINVAL if the resource is not valid.

This function removes a resource previously inserted by \fBinsert_resource\fP
or \fBinsert_resource_conflict\fP, and moves the children (if any) up to
where they were before.  \fBinsert_resource\fP and \fBinsert_resource_conflict\fP
insert a new resource, and move any conflicting resources down to the
children of the new resource.

\fBinsert_resource\fP, \fBinsert_resource_conflict\fP and \fBremove_resource\fP are
intended for producers of resources, such as FW modules and bus drivers.
