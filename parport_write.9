.SH NAME
parport_write \- write a block of data to a parallel port
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "ssize_t" parport_write
.BI "(struct parport *port "  ","
.BI "const void *buffer "  ","
.BI "size_t len "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "port" 12
port to write to
.IP "buffer" 12
data buffer (in kernel space)
.IP "len" 12
number of bytes of data to transfer

This will write up to \fIlen\fP bytes of \fIbuffer\fP to the port
specified, using the IEEE 1284 transfer mode most recently
negotiated to (using \fBparport_negotiate\fP), as long as that
mode supports forward transfers (host to peripheral).

It is the caller's responsibility to ensure that the first
\fIlen\fP bytes of \fIbuffer\fP are valid.

This function returns the number of bytes transferred (if zero
or positive), or else an error code.
