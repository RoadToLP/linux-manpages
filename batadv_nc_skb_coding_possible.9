.BI "(struct sk_buff *skb "  ","
.BI "u8 *dst "  ","
.BI "u8 *src "  ");"

destination mac address of the other skb to code with
.IP "src" 12
source mac address of skb
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Whenever we network code a packet we have to check whether we received it in
a network coded form. If so, we may not be able to use it for coding because
some neighbors may also have received (overheard) the packet in the network
coded form without being able to decode it. It is hard to know which of the
neighboring nodes was able to decode the packet, therefore we can only
re-code the packet if the source of the previous encoded packet is involved.
Since the source encoded the packet we can be certain it has all necessary
decode information.
.SH "RETURN"
true if coding of a decoded packet is allowed.
