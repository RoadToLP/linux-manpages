.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function enables consolidation by putting all the orphans into the list
to commit. The list is in the order that the orphans were added, and the
LEBs are written atomically in order, so at no time can orphans be lost by
an unclean unmount.

This function returns 0 on success and a negative error code on failure.
