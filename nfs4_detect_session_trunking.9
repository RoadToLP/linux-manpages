.SH NAME
nfs4_detect_session_trunking \- Checks for session trunking.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" nfs4_detect_session_trunking
.BI "(struct nfs_client *clp "  ","
.BI "struct nfs41_exchange_id_res *res "  ","
.BI "struct rpc_xprt *xprt "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "clp" 12
original mount nfs_client
.IP "res" 12
result structure from an exchange_id using the original mount
nfs_client with a new multi_addr transport
.IP "xprt" 12
pointer to the transport to add.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Called after a successful EXCHANGE_ID on a multi-addr connection.
Upon success, add the transport.

Returns zero on success, otherwise -EINVAL
.SH "NOTE"
since the exchange_id for the new multi_addr transport uses the
same nfs_client from the original mount, the cl_owner_id is reused,
so eir_clientowner is the same.
