.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Do whatever is necessary for the hwmods underlying omap_device \fIod\fP
to be accessible and ready to operate.  This generally involves
enabling clocks, setting SYSCONFIG registers; and in the future may
involve remuxing pins.  Device drivers should call this function
indirectly via pm_runtime_get*().  Returns -EINVAL if called when
the omap_device is already enabled, or passes along the return
value of \fB_omap_device_enable_hwmods\fP.
