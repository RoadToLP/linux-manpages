reference we are trying to make active

Tries to acquire an active reference.  \fBgrab_super\fP is used when we
had just found a superblock in super_blocks or fs_type->fs_supers
and want to turn it into a full-blown active reference.  \fBgrab_super\fP
is called with sb_lock held and drops it.  Returns 1 in case of
success, 0 if we had failed (superblock contents was already dead or
dying when \fBgrab_super\fP had been called).  Note that this is only
called for superblocks not in rundown mode (== ones still on ->fs_supers
of their type), so increment of ->s_count is OK here.
