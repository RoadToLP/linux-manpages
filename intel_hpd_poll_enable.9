.SH NAME
intel_hpd_poll_enable \- enable polling for connectors with hpd
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" intel_hpd_poll_enable
.BI "(struct drm_i915_private *dev_priv "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dev_priv" 12
i915 device instance
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function enables polling for all connectors which support HPD.
Under certain conditions HPD may not be functional. On most Intel GPUs,
this happens when we enter runtime suspend.
On Valleyview and Cherryview systems, this also happens when we shut off all
of the powerwells.

Since this function can get called in contexts where we're already holding
dev->mode_config.mutex, we do the actual hotplug enabling in a seperate
worker.
