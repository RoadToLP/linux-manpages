.SH NAME
lpfc_els_disc_plogi \- Issue plogi for all npr nodes of a vport before adisc
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" lpfc_els_disc_plogi
.BI "(struct lpfc_vport *vport "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "vport" 12
pointer to a host virtual N_Port data structure.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This routine issues Port Login (PLOGI) ELS commands to all the N_Ports
which are in node port recovery state, with a \fIvport\fP. Each time an ELS
ADISC PLOGI IOCB is issued by invoking the \fBlpfc_issue_els_plogi\fP routine,
the per \fIvport\fP number of discover count (num_disc_nodes) shall be
incremented. If the num_disc_nodes reaches a pre-configured threshold
(cfg_discovery_threads), the \fIvport\fP fc_flag will be marked with FC_NLP_MORE
bit set and quit the process of issuing remaining ADISC PLOGIN IOCBs for
later pick up. On the other hand, after walking through all the ndlps with
the \fIvport\fP and there is none ADISC PLOGI IOCB issued, the \fIvport\fP fc_flag
shall be cleared with the FC_NLP_MORE bit indicating there is no more ADISC
PLOGI need to be sent.

Return code
The number of N_Ports with plogi issued.
