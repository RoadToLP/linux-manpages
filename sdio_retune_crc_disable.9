sdio_retune_crc_disable \- temporarily disable retuning on CRC errors
.SH SYNOPSIS

.BI "(struct sdio_func *func "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "func" 12
SDIO function attached to host

If the SDIO card is known to be in a state where it might produce
CRC errors on the bus in response to commands (like if we know it is
transitioning between power states), an SDIO function driver can
call this function to temporarily disable the SD/MMC core behavior of
triggering an automatic retuning.

This function should be called while the host is claimed and the host
should remain claimed until \fBsdio_retune_crc_enable\fP is called.
Specifically, the expected sequence of calls is:
- \fBsdio_claim_host\fP
- \fBsdio_retune_crc_disable\fP
- some number of calls like \fBsdio_writeb\fP and \fBsdio_readb\fP
- \fBsdio_retune_crc_enable\fP
- \fBsdio_release_host\fP
