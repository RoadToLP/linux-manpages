.SH NAME
pinctrl_ready_for_gpio_range \- check if other GPIO pins of the same GPIO chip are in range
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "bool" pinctrl_ready_for_gpio_range
.BI "(unsigned gpio "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gpio" 12
gpio pin to check taken from the global GPIO pin space
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function is complement of \fBpinctrl_match_gpio_range\fP. If the return
value of \fBpinctrl_match_gpio_range\fP is NULL, this function could be used
to check whether pinctrl device is ready or not. Maybe some GPIO pins
of the same GPIO chip don't have back-end pinctrl interface.
If the return value is true, it means that pinctrl device is ready & the
certain GPIO pin doesn't have back-end pinctrl device. If the return value
is false, it means that pinctrl device may not be ready.
