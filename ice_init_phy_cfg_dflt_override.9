.SH "DESCRIPTION"
If default override is enabled, initialized the user PHY cfg speed and FEC
settings using the default override mask from the NVM.

The PHY should only be configured with the default override settings the
first time media is available. The __ICE_LINK_DEFAULT_OVERRIDE_PENDING state
is used to indicate that the user PHY cfg default override is initialized
and the PHY has not been configured with the default override settings. The
state is set here, and cleared in ice_configure_phy the first time the PHY is
configured.
