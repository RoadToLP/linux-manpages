.SH NAME
omap2_dpll_round_rate \- round a target rate for an OMAP DPLL
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "long" omap2_dpll_round_rate
.BI "(struct clk_hw *hw "  ","
.BI "unsigned long target_rate "  ","
.BI "unsigned long *parent_rate "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "hw" 12
struct clk_hw containing the struct clk * for a DPLL
.IP "target_rate" 12
desired DPLL clock rate
.IP "parent_rate" 12
parent's DPLL clock rate
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Given a DPLL and a desired target rate, round the target rate to a
possible, programmable rate for this DPLL.  Attempts to select the
minimum possible n.  Stores the computed (m, n) in the DPLL's
dpll_data structure so \fBset_rate\fP will not need to call this
(expensive) function again.  Returns ~0 if the target rate cannot
be rounded, or the rounded rate upon success.
