.SH NAME
find_acpi_cpu_topology_hetero_id \- Get a core architecture tag
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" find_acpi_cpu_topology_hetero_id
.BI "(unsigned int cpu "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "cpu" 12
Kernel logical CPU number
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Determine a unique heterogeneous tag for the given CPU. CPUs with the same
implementation should have matching tags.

The returned tag can be used to group peers with identical implementation.

The search terminates when a level is found with the identical implementation
flag set or we reach a root node.

Due to limitations in the PPTT data structure, there may be rare situations
where two cores in a heterogeneous machine may be identical, but won't have
the same tag.
.SH "RETURN"
-ENOENT if the PPTT doesn't exist, or the CPU cannot be found.
Otherwise returns a value which represents a group of identical cores
similar to this CPU.
