.SH NAME
gmap_shadow_r2t \- create an empty shadow region 2 table
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" gmap_shadow_r2t
.BI "(struct gmap *sg "  ","
.BI "unsigned long saddr "  ","
.BI "unsigned long r2t "  ","
.BI "int fake "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "sg" 12
pointer to the shadow guest address space structure
.IP "saddr" 12
faulting address in the shadow gmap
.IP "r2t" 12
parent gmap address of the region 2 table to get shadowed
.IP "fake" 12
r2t references contiguous guest memory block, not a r2t
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The r2t parameter specifies the address of the source table. The
four pages of the source table are made read-only in the parent gmap
address space. A write to the source table area \fIr2t\fP will automatically
remove the shadow r2 table and all of its decendents.

Returns 0 if successfully shadowed or already shadowed, -EAGAIN if the
shadow table structure is incomplete, -ENOMEM if out of memory and
-EFAULT if an address in the parent gmap could not be resolved.

Called with sg->mm->mmap_lock in read.
