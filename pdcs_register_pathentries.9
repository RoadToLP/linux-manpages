.SH "DESCRIPTION"

It creates kobjects corresponding to each path entry with nice sysfs
links to the real device. This is where the magic takes place: when
registering the subsystem attributes during module init, each kobject hereby
created will show in the sysfs tree as a folder containing files as defined
by path_subsys_attr[].
