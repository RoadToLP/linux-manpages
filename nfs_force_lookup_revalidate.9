.SH NAME
nfs_force_lookup_revalidate \- Mark the directory as having changed
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" nfs_force_lookup_revalidate
.BI "(struct inode *dir "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dir" 12
pointer to directory inode
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This forces the revalidation code in \fBnfs_lookup_revalidate\fP to do a
full lookup on all child dentries of 'dir' whenever a change occurs
on the server that might have invalidated our dcache.

Note that we reserve bit '0' as a tag to let us know when a dentry
was revalidated while holding a delegation on its inode.

The caller should be holding dir->i_lock
