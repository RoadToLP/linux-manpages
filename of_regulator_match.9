.SH NAME
of_regulator_match \- extract multiple regulator init data from device tree.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" of_regulator_match
.BI "(struct device *dev "  ","
.BI "struct device_node *node "  ","
.BI "struct of_regulator_match *matches "  ","
.BI "unsigned int num_matches "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dev" 12
device requesting the data
.IP "node" 12
parent device node of the regulators
.IP "matches" 12
match table for the regulators
.IP "num_matches" 12
number of entries in match table
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function uses a match table specified by the regulator driver to
parse regulator init data from the device tree. \fInode\fP is expected to
contain a set of child nodes, each providing the init data for one
regulator. The data parsed from a child node will be matched to a regulator
based on either the deprecated property regulator-compatible if present,
or otherwise the child node's name. Note that the match table is modified
in place and an additional of_node reference is taken for each matched
regulator.

Returns the number of matches found or a negative error code on failure.
