.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" fc_rport_enter_delete
.BI "(struct fc_rport_priv *rdata "  ","
.BI "enum fc_rport_event event "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "rdata" 12
The remote port to be deleted
.IP "event" 12
The event to report as the reason for deletion
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Allow state change into DELETE only once.

Call queue_work only if there's no event already pending.
Set the new event so that the old pending event will not occur.
Since we have the mutex, even if \fBfc_rport_work\fP is already started,
it'll see the new event.
