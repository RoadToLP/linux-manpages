Userland CUSE server can create a CUSE device by opening /dev/cuse
and replying to the initialization request kernel sends.  This
function is responsible for handling CUSE device initialization.
Because the fd opened by this function is used during
initialization, this function only creates cuse_conn and sends
init.  The rest is delegated to a kthread.
.SH "RETURN"
0 on success, -errno on failure.
