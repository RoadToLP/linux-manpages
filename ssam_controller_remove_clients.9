.SH NAME
ssam_controller_remove_clients \- Remove SSAM client devices registered as direct children under the given controller.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" ssam_controller_remove_clients
.BI "(struct ssam_controller *ctrl "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "ctrl" 12
The controller to remove all direct clients for.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Remove all SSAM client devices registered as direct children under the
given controller. Note that this only accounts for direct children of the
controller device. This does not take care of any client devices where the
parent device has been manually set before calling ssam_device_add. Refer
to \fBssam_device_add\fP/\fBssam_device_remove\fP for more details on those cases.

To avoid new devices being added in parallel to this call, the main
controller lock (not statelock) must be held during this (and if
necessary, any subsequent deinitialization) call.
