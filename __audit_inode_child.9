.SH "DESCRIPTION"
For syscalls that create or remove filesystem objects, audit_inode
can only collect information for the filesystem object's parent.
This call updates the audit context with the child's information.
Syscalls that create a new filesystem object must be hooked after
the object is created.  Syscalls that remove a filesystem object
must be hooked prior, in order to capture the target inode during
unsuccessful attempts.
