.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "adapter" 12
the adapter
.IP "id" 12
the queue set id
.IP "nports" 12
how many Ethernet ports will be using this queue set
.IP "irq_vec_idx" 12
the IRQ vector index for response queue interrupts
.IP "p" 12
configuration parameters for this queue set
.IP "ntxq" 12
number of Tx queues for the queue set
.IP "dev" 12
net device associated with this queue set
.IP "netdevq" 12
net device TX queue associated with this queue set

Allocate resources and initialize an SGE queue set.  A queue set
comprises a response queue, two Rx free-buffer queues, and up to 3
Tx queues.  The Tx queues are assigned roles in the order Ethernet
queue, offload queue, and control queue.
