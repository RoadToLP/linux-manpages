.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Returns positive if the regulator driver backing the source/client
has requested that the device be enabled, zero if it hasn't, else a
negative errno code.

Note that the device backing this regulator handle can have multiple
users, so it might be enabled even if \fBregulator_enable\fP was never
called for this particular source.
