.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This routine issues a Process Login (PRLI) ELS command for the
\fIvport\fP. The PRLI service parameters are set up in the payload of the
PRLI Request command and the pointer to \fBlpfc_cmpl_els_prli\fP routine
is put to the IOCB completion callback func field before invoking the
routine \fBlpfc_sli_issue_iocb\fP to send out PRLI command.

Note that, in \fBlpfc_prep_els_iocb\fP routine, the reference count of ndlp
will be incremented by 1 for holding the ndlp and the reference to ndlp
will be stored into the context1 field of the IOCB for the completion
callback function to the PRLI ELS command.

Return code
0 - successfully issued prli iocb command for \fIvport\fP
1 - failed to issue prli iocb command for \fIvport\fP
