.SH NAME
xas_find_marked \- Find the next marked entry in the XArray.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void *" xas_find_marked
.BI "(struct xa_state *xas "  ","
.BI "unsigned long max "  ","
.BI "xa_mark_t mark "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "xas" 12
XArray operation state.
.IP "max" 12
Highest index to return.
.IP "mark" 12
Mark number to search for.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
If the \fIxas\fP has not yet been walked to an entry, return the marked entry
which has an index >= xas.xa_index.  If it has been walked, the entry
currently being pointed at has been processed, and so we return the
first marked entry with an index > xas.xa_index.

If no marked entry is found and the array is smaller than \fImax\fP, \fIxas\fP is
set to the bounds state and xas->xa_index is set to the smallest index
not yet in the array.  This allows \fIxas\fP to be immediately passed to
\fBxas_store\fP.

If no entry is found before \fImax\fP is reached, \fIxas\fP is set to the restart
state.
.SH "RETURN"
The entry, if found, otherwise NULL.
