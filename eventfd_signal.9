.SH SYNOPSIS

.BI "(struct eventfd_ctx *ctx "  ","
.BI "__u64 n "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "ctx" 12
[in] Pointer to the eventfd context.
.IP "n" 12
[in] Value of the counter to be added to the eventfd internal counter.
The value cannot be negative.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function is supposed to be called by the kernel in paths that do not
allow sleeping. In this function we allow the counter to reach the ULLONG_MAX
value, and we signal this as overflow condition by returning a EPOLLERR
to poll(2).

Returns the amount by which the counter was incremented.  This will be less
than \fIn\fP if the counter has overflowed.
