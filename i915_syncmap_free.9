.SH NAME
i915_syncmap_free \- - free all memory associated with the syncmap
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" i915_syncmap_free
.BI "(struct i915_syncmap **root "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "root" 12
pointer to the #i915_syncmap
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Either when the timeline is to be freed and we no longer need the sync
point tracking, or when the fences are all known to be signaled and the
sync point tracking is redundant, we can free the #i915_syncmap to recover
its allocations.

Will reinitialise the \fIroot\fP pointer so that the #i915_syncmap is ready for
reuse.
