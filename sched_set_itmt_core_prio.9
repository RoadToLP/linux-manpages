.SH NAME
sched_set_itmt_core_prio \- Set CPU priority based on ITMT
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" sched_set_itmt_core_prio
.BI "(int prio "  ","
.BI "int core_cpu "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "prio" 12
Priority of cpu core
.IP "core_cpu" 12
The cpu number associated with the core
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The pstate driver will find out the max boost frequency
and call this function to set a priority proportional
to the max boost frequency. CPU with higher boost
frequency will receive higher priority.

No need to rebuild sched domain after updating
the CPU priorities. The sched domains have no
dependency on CPU priorities.
