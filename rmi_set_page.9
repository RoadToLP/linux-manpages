.SH NAME
rmi_set_page \- Set RMI page
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" rmi_set_page
.BI "(struct hid_device *hdev "  ","
.BI "u8 page "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "hdev" 12
The pointer to the hid_device struct
.IP "page" 12
The new page address.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
RMI devices have 16-bit addressing, but some of the physical
implementations (like SMBus) only have 8-bit addressing. So RMI implements
a page address at 0xff of every page so we can reliable page addresses
every 256 registers.

The page_mutex lock must be held when this function is entered.

Returns zero on success, non-zero on failure.
