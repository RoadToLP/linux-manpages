.SH NAME
of_icc_get \- get a path handle from a DT node based on name
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "struct icc_path *" of_icc_get
.BI "(struct device *dev "  ","
.BI "const char *name "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dev" 12
device pointer for the consumer device
.IP "name" 12
interconnect path name
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function will search for a path between two endpoints and return an
icc_path handle on success. Use \fBicc_put\fP to release constraints when they
are not needed anymore.
If the interconnect API is disabled, NULL is returned and the consumer
drivers will still build. Drivers are free to handle this specifically,
but they don't have to.
.SH "RETURN"
icc_path pointer on success or \fBERR_PTR\fP on error. NULL is returned
when the API is disabled or the "interconnects" DT property is missing.
