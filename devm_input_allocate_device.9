.SH NAME
devm_input_allocate_device \- allocate managed input device
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "struct input_dev *" devm_input_allocate_device
.BI "(struct device *dev "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dev" 12
device owning the input device being created
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Returns prepared struct input_dev or NULL.

Managed input devices do not need to be explicitly unregistered or
freed as it will be done automatically when owner device unbinds from
its driver (or binding fails). Once managed input device is allocated,
it is ready to be set up and registered in the same fashion as regular
input device. There are no special devm_input_device_[un]\fBregister\fP
variants, regular ones work with both managed and unmanaged devices,
should you need them. In most cases however, managed input device need
not be explicitly unregistered or freed.
.SH "NOTE"
the owner device is set up as parent of input device and users
should not override it.
