.SH SYNOPSIS

.BI "(struct drm_device *dev "  ","
.BI "struct drm_atomic_state *state "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dev" 12
DRM device
.IP "state" 12
the driver state object
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function commits a state asynchronously, i.e., not vblank
synchronized. It should be used on a state only when
\fBdrm_atomic_async_check\fP succeeds. Async commits are not supposed to swap
the states like normal sync commits, but just do in-place changes on the
current state.

TODO: Implement full swap instead of doing in-place changes.
