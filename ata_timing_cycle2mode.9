.SH NAME
ata_timing_cycle2mode \- find xfer mode for the specified cycle duration
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "u8" ata_timing_cycle2mode
.BI "(unsigned int xfer_shift "  ","
.BI "int cycle "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "xfer_shift" 12
ATA_SHIFT_* value for transfer type to examine.
.IP "cycle" 12
cycle duration in ns

Return matching xfer mode for \fIcycle\fP.  The returned mode is of
the transfer type specified by \fIxfer_shift\fP.  If \fIcycle\fP is too
slow for \fIxfer_shift\fP, 0xff is returned.  If \fIcycle\fP is faster
than the fastest known mode, the fasted mode is returned.

LOCKING:
None.
.SH "RETURN"
Matching xfer_mode, 0xff if no match found.
