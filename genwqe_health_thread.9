genwqe_health_thread \- Health checking thread

GenWQE device information
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This thread is only started for the PF of the card.

This thread monitors the health of the card. A critical situation
is when we read registers which contain -1 (IO_ILLEGAL_VALUE). In
this case we need to be recovered from outside. Writing to
registers will very likely not work either.

This thread must only exit if \fBkthread_should_stop\fP becomes true.

Condition for the health-thread to trigger:
a) when a \fBkthread_stop\fP request comes in or
b) a critical GFIR occured

Informational GFIRs are checked and potentially printed in
GENWQE_HEALTH_CHECK_INTERVAL seconds.
