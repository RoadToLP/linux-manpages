if we want to do a RESET to restart things

Restart firmware previously halted by \fBt4_fw_halt\fP.  On successful
return the previous PF Master remains as the new PF Master and there
is no need to issue a new HELLO command, etc.

We do this in two ways:

1. If we're dealing with newer firmware we'll simply want to take
the chip's microprocessor out of RESET.  This will cause the
firmware to start up from its start vector.  And then we'll loop
until the firmware indicates it's started again (PCIE_FW.HALT
reset to 0) or we timeout.

2. If we're dealing with older firmware then we'll need to RESET
the chip since older firmware won't recognize the PCIE_FW.HALT
flag and automatically RESET itself on startup.
