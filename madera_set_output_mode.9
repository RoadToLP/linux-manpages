.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Some systems use external analogue switches to connect more
analogue devices to the CODEC than are supported by the device.  In
some systems this requires changing the switched output from single
ended to differential mode dynamically at runtime, an operation
supported using this function.

Most systems have a single static configuration and should use
platform data instead.
