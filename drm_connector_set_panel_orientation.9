.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" drm_connector_set_panel_orientation
.BI "(struct drm_connector *connector "  ","
.BI "enum drm_panel_orientation panel_orientation "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function sets the connector's panel_orientation and attaches
a "panel orientation" property to the connector.

Calling this function on a connector where the panel_orientation has
already been set is a no-op (e.g. the orientation has been overridden with
a kernel commandline option).

It is allowed to call this function with a panel_orientation of
DRM_MODE_PANEL_ORIENTATION_UNKNOWN, in which case it is a no-op.
.SH "RETURN"
Zero on success, negative errno on failure.
