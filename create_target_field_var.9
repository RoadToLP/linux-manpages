.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "target_hist_data" 12
The target hist trigger
.IP "subsys_name" 12
Optional subsystem name
.IP "event_name" 12
Optional event name
.IP "var_name" 12
The name of the field (and the resulting variable)
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Hist trigger actions fetch data from variables, not directly from
events.  However, for convenience, users are allowed to directly
specify an event field in an action, which will be automatically
converted into a variable on their behalf.
This function creates a field variable with the name var_name on
the hist trigger currently being defined on the target event.  If
subsys_name and event_name are specified, this function simply
verifies that they do in fact match the target event subsystem and
event name.
.SH "RETURN"
The variable created for the field.
