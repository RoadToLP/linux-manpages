.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "u32" cbm_ensure_valid
.BI "(u32 _val "  ","
.BI "struct rdt_resource *r "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "_val" 12
Candidate CBM
.IP "r" 12
RDT resource to which the CBM belongs
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The provided CBM represents all cache portions available for use. This
may be represented by a bitmap that does not consist of contiguous ones
and thus be an invalid CBM.
Here the provided CBM is forced to be a valid CBM by only considering
the first set of contiguous bits as valid and clearing all bits.
The intention here is to provide a valid default CBM with which a new
resource group is initialized. The user can follow this with a
modification to the CBM if the default does not satisfy the
requirements.
