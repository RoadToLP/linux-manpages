.BI "(struct regmap *map "  ","
.BI "const struct reg_sequence *regs "  ","
.BI "int num_regs "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "map" 12
Register map to write to
.IP "regs" 12
Array of structures containing register,value to be written
.IP "num_regs" 12
Number of registers to write
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Write multiple registers to the device where the set of register, value
pairs are supplied in any order, possibly not all in a single range.

The 'normal' block write mode will send ultimately send data on the
target bus as R,V1,V2,V3,..,Vn where successively higher registers are
addressed. However, this alternative block multi write mode will send
the data as R1,V1,R2,V2,..,Rn,Vn on the target bus. The target device
must of course support the mode.

A value of zero will be returned on success, a negative errno will be
returned in error cases.
