.SH NAME
request_percpu_nmi \- allocate a percpu interrupt line for NMI delivery
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" request_percpu_nmi
.BI "(unsigned int irq "  ","
.BI "irq_handler_t handler "  ","
.BI "const char *name "  ","
.BI "void __percpu *dev_id "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "irq" 12
Interrupt line to allocate
.IP "handler" 12
Function to be called when the IRQ occurs.
.IP "name" 12
An ascii name for the claiming device
.IP "dev_id" 12
A percpu cookie passed back to the handler function

This call allocates interrupt resources for a per CPU NMI. Per CPU NMIs
have to be setup on each CPU by calling \fBprepare_percpu_nmi\fP before
being enabled on the same CPU by using \fBenable_percpu_nmi\fP.

Dev_id must be globally unique. It is a per-cpu variable, and
the handler gets called with the interrupted CPU's instance of
that variable.

Interrupt lines requested for NMI delivering should have auto enabling
setting disabled.

If the interrupt line cannot be used to deliver NMIs, function
will fail returning a negative value.
