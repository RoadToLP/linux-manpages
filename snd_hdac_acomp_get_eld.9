the pin widget NID
.IP "dev_id" 12
device identifier
.IP "audio_enabled" 12
the pointer to store the current audio state

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function is supposed to be used only by a HD-audio controller
driver that needs the interaction with graphics driver.

This function queries the current state of the audio on the given
digital port and fetches the ELD bytes onto the given buffer.
It returns the number of bytes for the total ELD data, zero for
invalid ELD, or a negative error code.

The return size is the total bytes required for the whole ELD bytes,
thus it may be over \fImax_bytes\fP.  If it's over \fImax_bytes\fP, it implies
that only a part of ELD bytes have been fetched.
