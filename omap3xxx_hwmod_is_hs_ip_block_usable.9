.SH NAME
omap3xxx_hwmod_is_hs_ip_block_usable \- is a security IP block accessible?
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "bool" omap3xxx_hwmod_is_hs_ip_block_usable
.BI "(struct device_node *bus "  ","
.BI "const char *dev_name "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "bus" 12
struct device_node * for the top-level OMAP DT data
.IP "dev_name" 12
device name used in the DT file
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Determine whether a "secure" IP block \fIdev_name\fP is usable by Linux.
There doesn't appear to be a 100% reliable way to determine this,
so we rely on heuristics.  If \fIbus\fP is null, meaning there's no DT
data, then we only assume the IP block is accessible if the OMAP is
fused as a 'general-purpose' SoC.  If however DT data is present,
test to see if the IP block is described in the DT data and set to
'status = "okay"'.  If so then we assume the ODM has configured the
OMAP firewalls to allow access to the IP block.
.SH "RETURN"
0 if device named \fIdev_name\fP is not likely to be accessible,
or 1 if it is likely to be accessible.
