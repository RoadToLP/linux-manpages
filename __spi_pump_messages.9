.SH NAME
__spi_pump_messages \- function which processes spi message queue
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" __spi_pump_messages
.BI "(struct spi_controller *ctlr "  ","
.BI "bool in_kthread "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "ctlr" 12
controller to process queue for
.IP "in_kthread" 12
true if we are in the context of the message pump thread
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function checks if there is any spi message in the queue that
needs processing and if so call out to the driver to initialize hardware
and transfer each message.

Note that it is called both from the kthread itself and also from
inside \fBspi_sync\fP; the queue extraction handling at the top of the
function should deal with this safely.
