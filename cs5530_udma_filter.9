\fBcs5530_udma_filter\fP does UDMA mask filtering for the given drive
taking into the consideration capabilities of the mate device.

The CS5530 specifies that two drives sharing a cable cannot mix
UDMA/MDMA.  It has to be one or the other, for the pair, though
different timings can still be chosen for each drive.  We could
set the appropriate timing bits on the fly, but that might be
a bit confusing.  So, for now we statically handle this requirement
by looking at our mate drive to see what it is capable of, before
choosing a mode for our own drive.
.SH "NOTE"
This relies on the fact we never fail from UDMA to MWDMA2
but instead drop to PIO.
