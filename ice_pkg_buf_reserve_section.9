.SH NAME
ice_pkg_buf_reserve_section \- 
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "enum ice_status" ice_pkg_buf_reserve_section
.BI "(struct ice_buf_build *bld "  ","
.BI "u16 count "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "bld" 12
pointer to pkg build (allocated by \fBice_pkg_buf_alloc\fP)
.IP "count" 12
the number of sections to reserve
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Reserves one or more section table entries in a package buffer. This routine
can be called multiple times as long as they are made before calling
\fBice_pkg_buf_alloc_section\fP. Once \fBice_pkg_buf_alloc_section\fP
is called once, the number of sections that can be allocated will not be able
to be increased; not using all reserved sections is fine, but this will
result in some wasted space in the buffer.
.SH "NOTE"
all package contents must be in Little Endian form.
