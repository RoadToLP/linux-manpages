.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function perform teardown the following:
- Virtual block list of available virtual memory.
- Virtual address to area descriptor hashtable.
- MMU for context.

In addition this function does the following:
- Unmaps the existing hashtable nodes if the hashtable is not empty. The
hashtable should be empty as no valid mappings should exist at this
point.
- Frees any existing physical page list from the idr which relates to the
current context asid.
- This function checks the virtual block list for correctness. At this point
the list should contain one element which describes the whole virtual
memory range of the context. Otherwise, a warning is printed.
