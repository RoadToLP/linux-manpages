.SH "DESCRIPTION"
With RCU path tracing, it may race with \fBd_move\fP. Use \fBREAD_ONCE\fP to
make sure that either the old or the new name pointer and length are
fetched. However, there may be mismatch between length and pointer.
The length cannot be trusted, we need to copy it byte-by-byte until
the length is reached or a null byte is found. It also prepends "/" at
the beginning of the name. The sequence number check at the caller will
retry it again when a \fBd_move\fP does happen. So any garbage in the buffer
due to mismatched pointer and length will be discarded.

Load acquire is needed to make sure that we see that terminating NUL.
