.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" crossbar_domain_free
.BI "(struct irq_domain *domain "  ","
.BI "unsigned int virq "  ","
.BI "unsigned int nr_irqs "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "domain" 12
domain of irq to unmap
.IP "virq" 12
virq number
.IP "nr_irqs" 12
number of irqs to free
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
We do not maintain a use count of total number of map/unmap
calls for a particular irq to find out if a irq can be really
unmapped. This is because unmap is called during irq_dispose_mapping(irq),
after which irq is anyways unusable. So an explicit map has to be called
after that.
