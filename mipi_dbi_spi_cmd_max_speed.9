.SH NAME
mipi_dbi_spi_cmd_max_speed \- get the maximum SPI bus speed
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "u32" mipi_dbi_spi_cmd_max_speed
.BI "(struct spi_device *spi "  ","
.BI "size_t len "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "spi" 12
SPI device
.IP "len" 12
The transfer buffer length.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Many controllers have a max speed of 10MHz, but can be pushed way beyond
that. Increase reliability by running pixel data at max speed and the rest
at 10MHz, preventing transfer glitches from messing up the init settings.
