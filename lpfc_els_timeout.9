.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This routine is invoked by the ELS timer after timeout. It posts the ELS
timer timeout event by setting the WORKER_ELS_TMO bit to the work port
event bitmap and then invokes the \fBlpfc_worker_wake_up\fP routine to wake
up the worker thread. It is for the worker thread to invoke the routine
\fBlpfc_els_timeout_handler\fP to work on the posted event WORKER_ELS_TMO.
