Many of the strings in the LDM Database are not NULL terminated.  Instead
they are prefixed by a one byte length marker.  This function copies one of
these strings into a buffer.

N.B.  This function DOES NOT perform any range checking on the input.
If the buffer is too small, the output will be truncated.
.SH "RETURN"
0, Error and \fIbuffer\fP contents are undefined
n, String length in characters (excluding NULL)
buflen-1, String was truncated.
