pointer to the HW structure

PCH does not control LEDs via the LEDCTL register, rather it uses
the PHY LED configuration register.

PCH also does not have an "always on" or "always off" mode which
complicates the ID feature.  Instead of using the "on" mode to indicate
in ledctl_mode2 the LEDs to use for ID (see \fBe1000e_id_led_init_generic\fP),
use "link_up" mode.  The LEDs will still ID on request if there is no
link based on logic in e1000_led_[on|off]\fB_pchlan\fP.
