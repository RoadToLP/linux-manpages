.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Maps an object consisting of \fInum\fP pages, catering for the user's
requested vm_pgoff

If we fail to insert any page into the vma, the function will return
immediately leaving any previously inserted pages present.  Callers
from the mmap handler may immediately return the error as their caller
will destroy the vma, removing any successfully inserted pages. Other
callers should make their own arrangements for calling \fBunmap_region\fP.
.SH "CONTEXT"
Process context. Called by mmap handlers.
.SH "RETURN"
0 on success and error code otherwise.
