.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This routine is a generic completion callback function for ELS commands.
Specifically, it is the callback function which does not need to perform
any command specific operations. It is currently used by the ELS command
issuing routines for RSCN, lpfc_issue_els_rscn, and the ELS Fibre Channel
Address Resolution Protocol Response (FARPR) routine, \fBlpfc_issue_els_farpr\fP.
Other than certain debug loggings, this callback function simply invokes the
\fBlpfc_els_chk_latt\fP routine to check whether link went down during the
discovery process.
