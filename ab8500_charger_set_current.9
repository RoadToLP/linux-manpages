.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Set charger current.
There is no state machine in the AB to step up/down the charger
current to avoid dips and spikes on MAIN, VBUS and VBAT when
charging is started. Instead we need to implement
this charger current step-up/down here.
Returns error code in case of failure else 0(on success)
