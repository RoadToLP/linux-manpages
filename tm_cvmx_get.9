This function gets in transaction checkpointed VMX registers.

When the transaction is active 'ckvr_state' and 'ckvrsave' hold
the checkpointed values for the current transaction to fall
back on if it aborts in between. The userspace interface buffer
layout is as follows.

struct data {
vector128       vr[32];
vector128       vscr;
vector128       vrsave;
};
