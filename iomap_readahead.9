.SH NAME
iomap_readahead \- Attempt to read pages from a file.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" iomap_readahead
.BI "(struct readahead_control *rac "  ","
.BI "const struct iomap_ops *ops "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "rac" 12
Describes the pages to be read.
.IP "ops" 12
The operations vector for the filesystem.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function is for filesystems to call to implement their readahead
address_space operation.
.SH "CONTEXT"
The \fIops\fP callbacks may submit I/O (eg to read the addresses of
blocks from disc), and may wait for it.  The caller may be trying to
access a different page, and so sleeping excessively should be avoided.
It may allocate memory, but should avoid costly allocations.  This
function is called with memalloc_nofs set, so allocations will not cause
the filesystem to be reentered.
