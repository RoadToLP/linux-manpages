.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This routine is used for irq controllers which can choose the hardware
interrupt numbers they generate. In such a case it's simplest to use
the linux irq as the hardware interrupt number. It still uses the linear
or radix tree to store the mapping, but the irq controller can optimize
the revmap path by using the hwirq directly.
