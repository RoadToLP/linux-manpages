.BI "(struct adapter *adapter "  ","
.BI "int reg "  ","

.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "adapter" 12
the adapter performing the operation
.IP "reg" 12
the register to check for completion
.IP "mask" 12
a single-bit field within \fIreg\fP that indicates completion
.IP "polarity" 12
the value of the field when the operation is completed
.IP "attempts" 12
number of check iterations
.IP "delay" 12
delay in usecs between iterations
.IP "valp" 12
where to store the value of the register at completion time

Wait until an operation is completed by checking a bit in a register
up to \fIattempts\fP times.  If \fIvalp\fP is not NULL the value of the register
at the time it indicated completion is stored there.  Returns 0 if the
operation completes and -EAGAIN otherwise.
