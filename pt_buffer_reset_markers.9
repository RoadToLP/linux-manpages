.SH NAME
pt_buffer_reset_markers \- place interrupt and stop bits in the buffer
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" pt_buffer_reset_markers
.BI "(struct pt_buffer *buf "  ","
.BI "struct perf_output_handle *handle "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "buf" 12
PT buffer.
.IP "handle" 12
Current output handle.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Place INT and STOP marks to prevent overwriting old data that the consumer
hasn't yet collected and waking up the consumer after a certain fraction of
the buffer has filled up. Only needed and sensible for non-snapshot counters.

This obviously relies on buf::head to figure out buffer markers, so it has
to be called after \fBpt_buffer_reset_offsets\fP and before the hardware tracing
is enabled.
