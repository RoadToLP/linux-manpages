.SH NAME
canon_copy_from_read_buf \- copy read data in canonical mode
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "bool" canon_copy_from_read_buf
.BI "(struct tty_struct *tty "  ","
.BI "unsigned char **kbp "  ","
.BI "size_t *nr "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "tty" 12
terminal device
.IP "kbp" 12
data
.IP "nr" 12
size of data

Helper function for n_tty_read.  It is only called when ICANON is on;
it copies one line of input up to and including the line-delimiting
character into the result buffer.

NB: When termios is changed from non-canonical to canonical mode and
the read buffer contains data, \fBn_tty_set_termios\fP simulates an EOF
push (as if C-d were input) _without_ the DISABLED_CHAR in the buffer.
This causes data already processed as input to be immediately available
as input although a newline has not been received.

Called under the atomic_read_lock mutex

\fBn_tty_read\fP/consumer path:
caller holds non-exclusive termios_rwsem
read_tail published
