.BI "struct cgroup_subsys_state *css "  ");"

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Associate \fIbio\fP with the blkg found by combining the css's blkg and the
request_queue of the \fIbio\fP.  An association failure is handled by walking up
the blkg tree.  Therefore, the blkg associated can be anything between \fIblkg\fP
and q->root_blkg.  This situation only happens when a cgroup is dying and
then the remaining bios will spill to the closest alive blkg.

A reference will be taken on the blkg and will be released when \fIbio\fP is
freed.
