Called to do the PIO mode setup. The MPIIX allows us to program the
IORDY sample point (2-5 clocks), recovery (1-4 clocks) and whether
prefetching or IORDY are used.

This would get very ugly because we can only program timing for one
device at a time, the other gets PIO0. Fortunately libata calls
our qc_issue command before a command is issued so we can flip the
timings back and forth to reduce the pain.
