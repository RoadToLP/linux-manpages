.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Releases the console_lock which the caller holds on the console system
and the console driver list.

While the console_lock was held, console output may have been buffered
by \fBprintk\fP.  If this is the case, \fBconsole_unlock\fP; emits
the output prior to releasing the lock.

If there is output waiting, we wake /dev/kmsg and \fBsyslog\fP users.

\fBconsole_unlock\fP; may be called from any context.
