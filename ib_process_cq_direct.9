.BI "int budget "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "cq" 12

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function is used to process all outstanding CQ entries.
It does not offload CQ processing to a different context and does
not ask for completion interrupts from the HCA.
Using direct processing on CQ with non IB_POLL_DIRECT type may trigger
concurrent processing.
.SH "NOTE"
do not pass -1 as budget unless it is guaranteed that the number
of completions that will be processed is small.
