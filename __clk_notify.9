.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Triggers a notifier call chain on the clk rate-change notification
for 'clk'.  Passes a pointer to the struct clk and the previous
and current rates to the notifier callback.  Intended to be called by
internal clock code only.  Returns NOTIFY_DONE from the last driver
called if all went well, or NOTIFY_STOP or NOTIFY_BAD immediately if
a driver returns that.
