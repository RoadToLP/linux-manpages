.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Delete the entry at the position currently pointed to by the iterator.
This may result in the current node being freed; if it is, the iterator
is advanced so that it will not reference the freed memory.  This
function may be called without any locking if there are no other threads
which can access this tree.
