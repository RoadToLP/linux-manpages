.BI "const unsigned char *data "  ","
.BI "short size "  ","
.BI "struct nvec_msg **msg "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "nvec" 12
An \fIstruct nvec_chip\fP
.IP "data" 12
The data to write
.IP "size" 12
The size of \fIdata\fP
.IP "msg" 12
The response message received
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This is similar to \fBnvec_write_async\fP, but waits for the
request to be answered before returning. This function
uses a mutex and can thus not be called from e.g.
interrupt handlers.
.SH "RETURN"
0 on success, a negative error code on failure.
The response message is returned in \fImsg\fP. Shall be freed
with \fBnvec_msg_free\fP once no longer used.
