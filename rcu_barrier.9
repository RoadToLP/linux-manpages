.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Note that this primitive does not necessarily wait for an RCU grace period
to complete.  For example, if there are no RCU callbacks queued anywhere
in the system, then \fBrcu_barrier\fP is within its rights to return
immediately, without waiting for anything, much less an RCU grace period.
