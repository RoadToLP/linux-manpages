.IP "i2400m" 12
device descriptor
.SH "RETURN"
0 if ok, < 0 errno code an error and a message in the
kernel log.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Long function, but quite simple; first chunk launches the command
and double checks the reply for the right TLV. Then we process the
TLV (where the meat is).

Once we process the TLV that gives us the firmware's interface
version, we encode it and save it in i2400m->fw_version for future
reference.
