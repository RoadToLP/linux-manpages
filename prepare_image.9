prepare_image \- Make room for loading hibernation image.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" prepare_image
.BI "(struct memory_bitmap *new_bm "  ","
.BI "struct memory_bitmap *bm "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "new_bm" 12
Unitialized memory bitmap structure.
.IP "bm" 12
Memory bitmap with unsafe pages marked.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Use \fIbm\fP to mark the pages that will be overwritten in the process of
restoring the system memory state from the suspend image ("unsafe" pages)
and allocate memory for the image.

The idea is to allocate a new memory bitmap first and then allocate
as many pages as needed for image data, but without specifying what those
pages will be used for just yet.  Instead, we mark them all as allocated and
create a lists of "safe" pages to be used later.  On systems with high
memory a list of "safe" highmem pages is created too.
