.SH NAME
usb_ep_fifo_status \- returns number of bytes in fifo, or error
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" usb_ep_fifo_status
.BI "(struct usb_ep *ep "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "ep" 12
the endpoint whose fifo status is being checked.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
FIFO endpoints may have "unclaimed data" in them in certain cases,
such as after aborted transfers.  Hosts may not have collected all
the IN data written by the gadget driver (and reported by a request
completion).  The gadget driver may not have collected all the data
written OUT to it by the host.  Drivers that need precise handling for
fault reporting or recovery may need to use this call.

This routine may be called in interrupt context.

This returns the number of such bytes in the fifo, or a negative
errno if the endpoint doesn't use a FIFO or doesn't support such
precise handling.
