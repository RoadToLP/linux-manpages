drm_gem_fb_create \- Helper function for the &drm_mode_config_funcs.fb_create callback
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "struct drm_framebuffer *" drm_gem_fb_create
.BI "(struct drm_device *dev "  ","
.BI "struct drm_file *file "  ","
.BI "const struct drm_mode_fb_cmd2 *mode_cmd "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dev" 12
DRM device
.IP "file" 12
DRM file that holds the GEM handle(s) backing the framebuffer
.IP "mode_cmd" 12

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function creates a new framebuffer object described by
\fIdrm_mode_fb_cmd2\fP. This description includes handles for the buffer(s)
backing the framebuffer.

If your hardware has special alignment or pitch requirements these should be
checked before calling this function. The function does buffer size
validation. Use \fBdrm_gem_fb_create_with_dirty\fP if you need framebuffer
flushing.

Drivers can use this as their \fIdrm_mode_config_funcs.fb_create\fP callback.
The ADDFB2 IOCTL calls into this callback.
.SH "RETURN"
Pointer to a \fIdrm_framebuffer\fP on success or an error pointer on failure.
