Disabling background operations improves command response latency but
has drawback of device moving into critical state where the device is
not-operable. Make sure to call \fBufshcd_enable_auto_bkops\fP whenever the
host is idle so that BKOPS are managed effectively without any negative
impacts.

Returns zero on success, non-zero on failure.
