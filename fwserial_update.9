.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Updates the new node_id and bus generation for this peer. Note that locking
is unnecessary; but careful memory barrier usage is important to enforce the
load and store order of generation & node_id.

The fw-core orders the write of node_id before generation in the parent
fw_device to ensure that a stale node_id cannot be used with a current
bus generation. So the generation value must be read before the node_id.

In turn, this orders the write of node_id before generation in the peer to
also ensure a stale node_id cannot be used with a current bus generation.
