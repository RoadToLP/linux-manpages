.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Invoke Apple's custom _DSM once to check the protocol version and once more
to retrieve the properties.  They are marshalled up in a single package as
alternating key/value elements, unlike _DSD which stores them as a package
of 2-element packages.  Convert to _DSD format and make them available under
the primary fwnode.
