.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dev" 12
the VSP device
.IP "pipe_index" 12
the DRM pipeline index
.IP "rpf_index" 12
index of the RPF to setup (0-based)
.IP "cfg" 12
the RPF configuration
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Configure the VSP to perform image composition through RPF \fIrpf_index\fP as
described by the \fIcfg\fP configuration. The image to compose is referenced by
\fIcfg.mem\fP and composed using the \fIcfg.src\fP crop rectangle and the \fIcfg.dst\fP
composition rectangle. The Z-order is configurable with higher \fIzpos\fP values
displayed on top.

If the \fIcfg\fP configuration is NULL, the RPF will be disabled. Calling the
function on a disabled RPF is allowed.

Image format as stored in memory is expressed as a V4L2 \fIcfg.pixelformat\fP
value. The memory pitch is configurable to allow for padding at end of lines,
or simply for images that extend beyond the crop rectangle boundaries. The
\fIcfg.pitch\fP value is expressed in bytes and applies to all planes for
multiplanar formats.

The source memory buffer is referenced by the DMA address of its planes in
the \fIcfg.mem\fP array. Up to two planes are supported. The second plane DMA
address is ignored for formats using a single plane.

This function isn't reentrant, the caller needs to serialize calls.

Return 0 on success or a negative error code on failure.
