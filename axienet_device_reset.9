.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function is called to reset and initialize the Axi Ethernet core. This
is typically called during initialization. It does a reset of the Axi DMA
Rx/Tx channels and initializes the Axi DMA BDs. Since Axi DMA reset lines
areconnected to Axi Ethernet reset lines, this in turn resets the Axi
Ethernet core. No separate hardware reset is done for the Axi Ethernet
core.
Returns 0 on success or a negative error number otherwise.
