type of stream (coupled, host or link stream)
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This assigns the stream based on the type (coupled/host/link), for the
given PCM substream, assigns it and returns the stream object

coupled: Looks for an unused stream
host: Looks for an unused decoupled host stream
link: Looks for an unused decoupled link stream

If no stream is free, returns NULL. The function tries to keep using
the same stream object when it's used beforehand.  when a stream is
decoupled, it becomes a host stream and link stream.
