.SH "DESCRIPTION"

If a resource is found, returns 0 and \fI\fP*res is overwritten with the part
of the resource that's within [\fIstart\fP..\fIend\fP]; if none is found, returns
-ENODEV.  Returns -EINVAL for invalid parameters.

This function walks the whole tree and not just first level children
unless \fIfirst_lvl\fP is true.

The caller must specify \fIstart\fP, \fIend\fP, \fIflags\fP, and \fIdesc\fP
(which may be IORES_DESC_NONE).
