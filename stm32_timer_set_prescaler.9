.SH NAME
stm32_timer_set_prescaler \- Compute and set the prescaler register
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" stm32_timer_set_prescaler
.BI "(struct timer_of *to "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "to" 12
a pointer to a timer-of structure
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Depending on the timer width, compute the prescaler to always
target a 10MHz timer rate for 16 bits. 32-bit timers are
considered precise and long enough to not use the prescaler.
