i40e_check_vf_permission \- 
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" i40e_check_vf_permission
.BI "(struct i40e_vf *vf "  ","
.BI "struct virtchnl_ether_addr_list *al "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "vf" 12
pointer to the VF info
.IP "al" 12
MAC address list from virtchnl
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Check that the given list of MAC addresses is allowed. Will return -EPERM
if any address in the list is not valid. Checks the following conditions:

1) broadcast and zero addresses are never valid
2) unicast addresses are not allowed if the VMM has administratively set
the VF MAC address, unless the VF is marked as privileged.
3) There is enough space to add all the addresses.

Note that to guarantee consistency, it is expected this function be called
while holding the mac_filter_hash_lock, as otherwise the current number of
addresses might not be accurate.
