.SH NAME
kernfs_unbreak_active_protection \- undo kernfs_break_active_protection()
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" kernfs_unbreak_active_protection
.BI "(struct kernfs_node *kn "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "kn" 12
the self kernfs_node
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
If \fBkernfs_break_active_protection\fP was called, this function must be
invoked before finishing the kernfs operation.  Note that while this
function restores the active reference, it doesn't and can't actually
restore the active protection - \fIkn\fP may already or be in the process of
being removed.  Once \fBkernfs_break_active_protection\fP is invoked, that
protection is irreversibly gone for the kernfs operation instance.

While this function may be called at any point after
\fBkernfs_break_active_protection\fP is invoked, its most useful location
would be right before the enclosing kernfs operation returns.
