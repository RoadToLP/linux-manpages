.SH NAME
exynos5_dmc_align_bypass_voltage \- Sets the voltage for the DMC
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" exynos5_dmc_align_bypass_voltage
.BI "(struct exynos5_dmc *dmc "  ","
.BI "unsigned long target_volt "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dmc" 12
device for which it is going to be set
.IP "target_volt" 12
new voltage which is chosen to be final
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Function tries to align voltage to the safe level for the 'bypass' mode.
It checks the need of higher voltage and changes the value.
The target voltage must not be less than currently needed, because
for current frequency the device might become unstable.
