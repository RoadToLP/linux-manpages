.SH NAME
batadv_v_forward_penalty \- apply a penalty to the throughput metric forwarded with B.A.T.M.A.N. V OGMs
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "u32" batadv_v_forward_penalty
.BI "(struct batadv_priv *bat_priv "  ","
.BI "struct batadv_hard_iface *if_incoming "  ","
.BI "struct batadv_hard_iface *if_outgoing "  ","
.BI "u32 throughput "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "bat_priv" 12
the bat priv with all the soft interface information
.IP "if_incoming" 12
the interface where the OGM has been received
.IP "if_outgoing" 12
the interface where the OGM has to be forwarded to
.IP "throughput" 12
the current throughput
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Apply a penalty on the current throughput metric value based on the
characteristic of the interface where the OGM has been received.

Initially the per hardif hop penalty is applied to the throughput. After
that the return value is then computed as follows:
- throughput * 50%          if the incoming and outgoing interface are the
same WiFi interface and the throughput is above
1MBit/s
- throughput                if the outgoing interface is the default
interface (i.e. this OGM is processed for the
internal table and not forwarded)
- throughput * node hop penalty  otherwise
.SH "RETURN"
the penalised throughput metric.
