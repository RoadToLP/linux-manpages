.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBblock_invalidatepage\fP is called when all or part of the page has become
invalidated by a truncate operation.

\fBblock_invalidatepage\fP does not have to release all buffers, but it must
ensure that no dirty buffer is left outside \fIoffset\fP and that no I/O
is underway against any of the blocks which are outside the truncation
point.  Because the caller is about to free (and possibly reuse) those
blocks on-disk.
