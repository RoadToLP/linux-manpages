.IP "port" 12
the Port ID
.IP "lc" 12
the Port's Link Configuration
.IP "sleep_ok" 12
if true we may sleep while awaiting command completion
.IP "timeout" 12
time to wait for command to finish before timing out
(negative implies \fIsleep_ok\fP=false)

Set up a port's MAC and PHY according to a desired link configuration.
- If the PHY can auto-negotiate first decide what to advertise, then
enable/disable auto-negotiation as desired, and reset.
- If the PHY does not auto-negotiate just reset it.
- If auto-negotiation is off set the MAC to the proper speed/duplex/FC,
otherwise do it later based on the outcome of auto-negotiation.
