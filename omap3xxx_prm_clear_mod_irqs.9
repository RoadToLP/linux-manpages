.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The purpose of this function is to clear any wake-up events latched
in the PRCM PM_WKST_x registers. It is possible that a wake-up event
may occur whilst attempting to clear a PM_WKST_x register and thus
set another bit in this register. A while loop is used to ensure
that any peripheral wake-up events occurring while attempting to
clear the PM_WKST_x are detected and cleared.
