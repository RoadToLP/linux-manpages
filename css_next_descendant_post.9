.SH NAME
css_next_descendant_post \- find the next descendant for post-order walk
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "struct cgroup_subsys_state *" css_next_descendant_post
.BI "(struct cgroup_subsys_state *pos "  ","
.BI "struct cgroup_subsys_state *root "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "pos" 12
the current position (NULL to initiate traversal)
.IP "root" 12
css whose descendants to walk
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
To be used by \fBcss_for_each_descendant_post\fP.  Find the next descendant
to visit for post-order traversal of \fIroot\fP's descendants.  \fIroot\fP is
included in the iteration and the last node to be visited.

While this function requires cgroup_mutex or RCU read locking, it
doesn't require the whole traversal to be contained in a single critical
section.  This function will return the correct next descendant as long
as both \fIpos\fP and \fIcgroup\fP are accessible and \fIpos\fP is a descendant of
\fIcgroup\fP.

If a subsystem synchronizes ->\fBcss_online\fP and the start of iteration, a
css which finished ->\fBcss_online\fP is guaranteed to be visible in the
future iterations and will stay visible until the last reference is put.
A css which hasn't finished ->\fBcss_online\fP or already finished
->\fBcss_offline\fP may show up during traversal.  It's each subsystem's
responsibility to synchronize against on/offlining.
