.BI "struct amdgpu_vm *vm "  ","
.BI "u32 pasid "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "adev" 12
amdgpu_device pointer
.IP "vm" 12

.IP "pasid" 12
pasid to use
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This only works on GFX VMs that don't have any BOs added and no
page tables allocated yet.

Changes the following VM parameters:
- use_cpu_for_update
- pte_supports_ats
- pasid (old PASID is released, because compute manages its own PASIDs)

Reinitializes the page directory to reflect the changed ATS
setting.
.SH "RETURN"
0 for success, -errno for errors.
