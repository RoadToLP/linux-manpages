.SH NAME
irq_domain_disconnect_hierarchy \- Mark the first unused level of a hierarchy
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" irq_domain_disconnect_hierarchy
.BI "(struct irq_domain *domain "  ","
.BI "unsigned int virq "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "domain" 12
IRQ domain from which the hierarchy is to be disconnected
.IP "virq" 12
IRQ number where the hierarchy is to be trimmed
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Marks the \fIvirq\fP level belonging to \fIdomain\fP as disconnected.
Returns -EINVAL if \fIvirq\fP doesn't have a valid irq_data pointing
to \fIdomain\fP.

Its only use is to be able to trim levels of hierarchy that do not
have any real meaning for this interrupt, and that the driver marks
as such from its .\fBalloc\fP callback.
