.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This routine is called when the peer acknowledges the receipt of Ack Vectors
up to and including \fIackno\fP. While based on section A.3 of RFC 4340, here
are additional precautions to prevent corrupted buffer state. In particular,
we use tail_ackno to identify outdated records; it always marks the earliest
packet of group (2) in 11.4.2.
