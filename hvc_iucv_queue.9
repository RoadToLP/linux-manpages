Buffer containing data to send.

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The function queues data for sending. To actually send the buffered data,
a work queue function is scheduled (with QUEUE_SNDBUF_DELAY).
The function returns the number of data bytes that has been buffered.

If the device is not connected, data is ignored and the function returns
\fIcount\fP.
If the buffer is full, the function returns 0.
If an existing IUCV communicaton path has been severed, -EPIPE is returned
(that can be passed to HVC layer to cause a tty hangup).
