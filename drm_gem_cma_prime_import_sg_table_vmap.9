.SH NAME
drm_gem_cma_prime_import_sg_table_vmap \- PRIME import another driver's scatter/gather table and get the virtual address of the buffer
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "struct drm_gem_object *" drm_gem_cma_prime_import_sg_table_vmap
.BI "(struct drm_device *dev "  ","
.BI "struct dma_buf_attachment *attach "  ","
.BI "struct sg_table *sgt "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dev" 12
DRM device
.IP "attach" 12
DMA-BUF attachment
.IP "sgt" 12
Scatter/gather table of pinned pages
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function imports a scatter/gather table using
\fBdrm_gem_cma_prime_import_sg_table\fP and uses \fBdma_buf_vmap\fP to get the kernel
virtual address. This ensures that a CMA GEM object always has its virtual
address set. This address is released when the object is freed.

This function can be used as the \fIdrm_driver.gem_prime_import_sg_table\fP
callback. The \fIDRM_GEM_CMA_DRIVER_OPS_VMAP\fP macro provides a shortcut to set
the necessary DRM driver operations.
.SH "RETURN"
A pointer to a newly created GEM object or an ERR_PTR-encoded negative
error code on failure.
