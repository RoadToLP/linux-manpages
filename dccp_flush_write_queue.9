.SH NAME
dccp_flush_write_queue \- Drain queue at end of connection
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" dccp_flush_write_queue
.BI "(struct sock *sk "  ","
.BI "long *time_budget "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "sk" 12
socket to be drained
.IP "time_budget" 12
time allowed to drain the queue
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Since dccp_sendmsg queues packets without waiting for them to be sent, it may
happen that the TX queue is not empty at the end of a connection. We give the
HC-sender CCID a grace period of up to \fItime_budget\fP jiffies. If this function
returns with a non-empty write queue, it will be purged later.
