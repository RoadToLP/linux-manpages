.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This should be called by all USB drivers that use the USB major number.
If CONFIG_USB_DYNAMIC_MINORS is enabled, the minor number will be
dynamically allocated out of the list of available ones.  If it is not
enabled, the minor number will be based on the next available free minor,
starting at the class_driver->minor_base.

This function also creates a usb class device in the sysfs tree.

\fBusb_deregister_dev\fP must be called when the driver is done with
the minor numbers given out by this function.
.SH "RETURN"
-EINVAL if something bad happens with trying to register a
device, and 0 on success.
