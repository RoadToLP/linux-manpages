.BI "(struct scsi_cmnd *cmnd "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS

Pointer to scsi_cmnd data structure.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This routine does host reset to the adaptor port. It brings the HBA
offline, performs a board restart, and then brings the board back online.
The lpfc_offline calls lpfc_sli_hba_down which will abort and local
reject all outstanding SCSI commands to the host and error returned
back to SCSI mid-level. As this will be SCSI mid-level's last resort
of error handling, it will only return error if resetting of the adapter
is not successful; in all other cases, will return success.

Return code :
0x2003 - Error
0x2002 - Success
