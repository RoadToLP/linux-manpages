.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" mite_init_ring_descriptors
.BI "(struct mite_ring *ring "  ","
.BI "struct comedi_subdevice *s "  ","
.BI "unsigned int nbytes "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "ring" 12
MITE dma ring.
.IP "s" 12
COMEDI subdevice.
.IP "nbytes" 12
the size of the dma ring (in bytes).
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Initializes the ring buffer descriptors to provide correct DMA transfer
links to the exact amount of memory required. When the ring buffer is
allocated by \fBmite_buf_change\fP, the default is to initialize the ring
to refer to the entire DMA data buffer. A command may call this function
later to re-initialize and shorten the amount of memory that will be
transferred.
