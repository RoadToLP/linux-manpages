.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Work queue function for kicking the charger watchdog.

For ABB revision 1.0 and 1.1 there is a bug in the watchdog
logic. That means we have to continuously kick the charger
watchdog even when no charger is connected. This is only
valid once the AC charger has been enabled. This is
a bug that is not handled by the algorithm and the
watchdog have to be kicked by the charger driver
when the AC charger is disabled
