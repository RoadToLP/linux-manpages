I3C device information
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Set master device info. This should be called from
\fIi3c_master_controller_ops\fP->\fBbus_init\fP.

Not all \fIi3c_device_info\fP fields are meaningful for a master device.
Here is a list of fields that should be properly filled:

- \fIi3c_device_info->dyn_addr\fP
- \fIi3c_device_info->bcr\fP
- \fIi3c_device_info->dcr\fP
- \fIi3c_device_info->pid\fP
- \fIi3c_device_info->hdr_cap\fP if I3C_BCR_HDR_CAP bit is set in
\fIi3c_device_info->bcr\fP

This function must be called with the bus lock held in maintenance mode.
.SH "RETURN"
0 if \fIinfo\fP contains valid information (not every piece of
information can be checked, but we can at least make sure \fIinfo->dyn_addr\fP
and \fIinfo->bcr\fP are correct), -EINVAL otherwise.
