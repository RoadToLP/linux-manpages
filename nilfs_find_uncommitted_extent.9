.IP "inode" 12
inode
.IP "start_blk" 12
start block offset (in)
.IP "blkoff" 12
start offset of the found extent (out)
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function searches an extent of buffers marked "delayed" which
starts from a block offset equal to or larger than \fIstart_blk\fP.  If
such an extent was found, this will store the start offset in
\fIblkoff\fP and return its length in blocks.  Otherwise, zero is
returned.
