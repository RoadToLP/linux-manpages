.SH NAME
em_dev_register_perf_domain \- Register the Energy Model (EM) for a device
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" em_dev_register_perf_domain
.BI "(struct device *dev "  ","
.BI "unsigned int nr_states "  ","
.BI "struct em_data_callback *cb "  ","
.BI "cpumask_t *cpus "  ","
.BI "bool milliwatts "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dev" 12
Device for which the EM is to register
.IP "nr_states" 12
Number of performance states to register
.IP "cb" 12
Callback functions providing the data of the Energy Model
.IP "cpus" 12
Pointer to cpumask_t, which in case of a CPU device is
obligatory. It can be taken from i.e. 'policy->cpus'. For other
type of devices this should be set to NULL.
.IP "milliwatts" 12
Flag indicating that the power values are in milliWatts or
in some other scale. It must be set properly.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Create Energy Model tables for a performance domain using the callbacks
defined in cb.

The \fImilliwatts\fP is important to set with correct value. Some kernel
sub-systems might rely on this flag and check if all devices in the EM are
using the same scale.

If multiple clients register the same performance domain, all but the first
registration will be ignored.

Return 0 on success
