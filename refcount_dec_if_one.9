.SH NAME
refcount_dec_if_one \- decrement a refcount if it is 1
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "bool" refcount_dec_if_one
.BI "(refcount_t *r "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "r" 12
the refcount
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
No atomic_t counterpart, it attempts a 1 -> 0 transition and returns the
success thereof.

Like all decrement operations, it provides release memory order and provides
a control dependency.

It can be used like a try-delete operator; this explicit case is provided
and not cmpxchg in generic, because that would allow implementing unsafe
operations.
.SH "RETURN"
true if the resulting refcount is 0, false otherwise
