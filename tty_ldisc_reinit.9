line discipline to reinitialize

Completely reinitialize the line discipline state, by closing the
current instance, if there is one, and opening a new instance. If
an error occurs opening the new non-N_TTY instance, the instance
is dropped and tty->ldisc reset to NULL. The caller can then retry
with N_TTY instead.

Returns 0 if successful, otherwise error code < 0
