.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Find and get the effective css of \fIcgrp\fP for \fIss\fP.  The effective css is
defined as the matching css of the nearest ancestor including self which
has \fIss\fP enabled.  If \fIss\fP is not mounted on the hierarchy \fIcgrp\fP is on,
the root css is returned, so this function always returns a valid css.

The returned css is not guaranteed to be online, and therefore it is the
callers responsibility to try get a reference for it.
