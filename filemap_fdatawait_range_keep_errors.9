.SH NAME
filemap_fdatawait_range_keep_errors \- wait for writeback to complete
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" filemap_fdatawait_range_keep_errors
.BI "(struct address_space *mapping "  ","
.BI "loff_t start_byte "  ","
.BI "loff_t end_byte "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "mapping" 12
address space structure to wait for
.IP "start_byte" 12
offset in bytes where the range starts
.IP "end_byte" 12
offset in bytes where the range ends (inclusive)
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Walk the list of under-writeback pages of the given address space in the
given range and wait for all of them.  Unlike \fBfilemap_fdatawait_range\fP,
this function does not clear error status of the address space.

Use this function if callers don't handle errors themselves.  Expected
call sites are system-wide / filesystem-wide data flushers: e.g. sync(2),
fsfreeze(8)
