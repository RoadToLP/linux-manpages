.SH ARGUMENTS

objagg instance
.IP "opt_algo_type" 12
type of hints finding algorithm
.SH "NOTE"

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
According to the algo type, the existing objects of objagg instance
are going to be went-through to assemble an optimal tree. We call this
tree hints. These hints can be later on used for creation of
a new objagg instance. There, the future object creations are going
to be consulted with these hints in order to find out, where exactly
the new object should be put as a root or delta.

Returns a pointer to hints instance in case of success,
otherwise it returns pointer error using ERR_PTR macro.
