.SH NAME
sugov_iowait_apply \- Apply the IO boost to a CPU.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" sugov_iowait_apply
.BI "(struct sugov_cpu *sg_cpu "  ","
.BI "u64 time "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "sg_cpu" 12
the sugov data for the cpu to boost
.IP "time" 12
the update time from the caller
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
A CPU running a task which woken up after an IO operation can have its
utilization boosted to speed up the completion of those IO operations.
The IO boost value is increased each time a task wakes up from IO, in
\fBsugov_iowait_apply\fP, and it's instead decreased by this function,
each time an increase has not been requested (!iowait_boost_pending).

A CPU which also appears to have been idle for at least one tick has also
its IO boost utilization reset.

This mechanism is designed to boost high frequently IO waiting tasks, while
being more conservative on tasks which does sporadic IO operations.
