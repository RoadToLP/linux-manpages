.SH NAME
i915_oa_stream_init \- validate combined props for OA stream and init
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" i915_oa_stream_init
.BI "(struct i915_perf_stream *stream "  ","
.BI "struct drm_i915_perf_open_param *param "  ","
.BI "struct perf_open_properties *props "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "stream" 12
An i915 perf stream
.IP "param" 12
The open parameters passed to `DRM_I915_PERF_OPEN`
.IP "props" 12
The property state that configures stream (individually validated)
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
While \fBread_properties_unlocked\fP validates properties in isolation it
doesn't ensure that the combination necessarily makes sense.

At this point it has been determined that userspace wants a stream of
OA metrics, but still we need to further validate the combined
properties are OK.

If the configuration makes sense then we can allocate memory for
a circular OA buffer and apply the requested metric set configuration.
.SH "RETURN"
zero on success or a negative error code.
