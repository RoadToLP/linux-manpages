ish_fw_xfer_direct_dma \- Loads ISH firmware using direct dma
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" ish_fw_xfer_direct_dma
.BI "(struct ishtp_cl_data *client_data "  ","
.BI "const struct firmware *fw "  ","
.BI "const struct shim_fw_info fw_info "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "client_data" 12
Client data instance
.IP "fw" 12
Pointer to firmware data struct in host memory
.IP "fw_info" 12
Loader firmware properties
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Host firmware load is a unique case where we need to download
a large firmware image (200+ Kb). This function implements
direct DMA transfer in kernel and ISH firmware. This allows
us to overcome the ISH-TP 4 Kb limit, and allows us to DMA
directly to ISH UMA at location of choice.
Function depends on corresponding support in ISH firmware.
.SH "RETURN"
0 for success, negative error code for failure.
