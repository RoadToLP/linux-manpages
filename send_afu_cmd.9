.SH NAME
send_afu_cmd \- builds and sends an internal AFU command
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" send_afu_cmd
.BI "(struct afu *afu "  ","
.BI "struct sisl_ioarcb *rcb "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "afu" 12
AFU associated with the host.
.IP "rcb" 12
Pre-populated IOARCB describing command to send.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The AFU can only take one internal AFU command at a time. This limitation is
enforced by using a mutex to provide exclusive access to the AFU during the
operation. This design point requires calling threads to not be on interrupt
context due to the possibility of sleeping during concurrent AFU operations.

The command status is optionally passed back to the caller when the caller
populates the IOASA field of the IOARCB with a pointer to an IOASA structure.
.SH "RETURN"
0 on success, -errno on failure
