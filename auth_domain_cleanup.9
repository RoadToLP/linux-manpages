.SH "DESCRIPTION"

On module unload the auth_domain_table must be empty.  To make it
easier to catch bugs which don't clean up domains properly, we
warn if anything remains in the table at cleanup time.

Note that we cannot proactively remove the domains at this stage.
The ->\fBrelease\fP function might be in a module that has already been
unloaded.
