.SH NAME
qrtr_tx_flow_failed \- flag that tx of confirm_rx flagged messages failed
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" qrtr_tx_flow_failed
.BI "(struct qrtr_node *node "  ","
.BI "int dest_node "  ","
.BI "int dest_port "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "node" 12
qrtr_node that the packet is to be send to
.IP "dest_node" 12
node id of the destination
.IP "dest_port" 12
port number of the destination
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Signal that the transmission of a message with confirm_rx flag failed. The
flow's "pending" counter will keep incrementing towards QRTR_TX_FLOW_HIGH,
at which point transmission would stall forever waiting for the resume TX
message associated with the dropped confirm_rx message.
Work around this by marking the flow as having a failed transmission and
cause the next transmission attempt to be sent with the confirm_rx.
