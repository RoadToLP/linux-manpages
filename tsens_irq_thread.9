.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Check all sensors to find ones that violated their threshold limits. If the
temperature is still outside the limits, call \fBthermal_zone_device_update\fP to
update the thresholds, else re-enable the interrupts.

The level-triggered interrupt might deassert if the temperature returned to
within the threshold limits by the time the handler got scheduled. We
consider the irq to have been handled in that case.
