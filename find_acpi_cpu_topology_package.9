.BI "(unsigned int cpu "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "cpu" 12
Kernel logical CPU number
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Determine a topology unique package ID for the given CPU.
This ID can then be used to group peers, which will have matching ids.

The search terminates when either a level is found with the PHYSICAL_PACKAGE
flag set or we reach a root node.
.SH "RETURN"
-ENOENT if the PPTT doesn't exist, or the CPU cannot be found.
Otherwise returns a value which represents the package for this CPU.
