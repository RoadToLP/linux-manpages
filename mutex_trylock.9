.SH NAME
mutex_trylock \- try to acquire the mutex, without waiting
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" mutex_trylock
.BI "(struct mutex *lock "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "lock" 12
the mutex to be acquired
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Try to acquire the mutex atomically. Returns 1 if the mutex
has been acquired successfully, and 0 on contention.

This function must not be used in interrupt context. The
mutex must be released by the same task that acquired it.
.SH "NOTE"
this function follows the \fBspin_trylock\fP convention, so
it is negated from the \fBdown_trylock\fP return values! Be careful
about this when converting semaphore users to mutexes.
