.SH NAME
acpi_dma_request_slave_chan_by_name \- Get the DMA slave channel
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "struct dma_chan *" acpi_dma_request_slave_chan_by_name
.BI "(struct device *dev "  ","
.BI "const char *name "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dev" 12
struct device to get DMA request from
.IP "name" 12
represents corresponding FixedDMA descriptor for \fIdev\fP
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
In order to support both Device Tree and ACPI in a single driver we
translate the names "tx" and "rx" here based on the most common case where
the first FixedDMA descriptor is TX and second is RX.

If the device has "dma-names" property the FixedDMA descriptor indices
are retrieved based on those. Otherwise the function falls back using
hardcoded indices.
.SH "RETURN"
Pointer to appropriate dma channel on success or an error pointer.
