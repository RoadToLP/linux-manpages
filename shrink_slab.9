.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Call the shrink functions to age shrinkable caches.

\fInid\fP is passed along to shrinkers with SHRINKER_NUMA_AWARE set,
unaware shrinkers will receive a node id of 0 instead.

\fImemcg\fP specifies the memory cgroup to target. Unaware shrinkers
are called only if it is the root cgroup.

\fIpriority\fP is sc->priority, we take the number of objects and >> by priority
in order to get the scan target.

Returns the number of reclaimed slab objects.
