.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Read the LTTPR common and DPRX capabilities and switch to non-transparent
link training mode if any is detected and read the PHY capabilities for all
detected LTTPRs. In case of an LTTPR detection error or if the number of
LTTPRs is more than is supported (8), fall back to the no-LTTPR,
transparent mode link training mode.
.SH "RETURN"
>0  if LTTPRs were detected and the non-transparent LT mode was set. The
DPRX capabilities are read out.
0  if no LTTPRs or more than 8 LTTPRs were detected or in case of a
detection failure and the transparent LT mode was set. The DPRX
capabilities are read out.
<0  Reading out the DPRX capabilities failed.
