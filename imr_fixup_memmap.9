.SH "DESCRIPTION"

BIOS and Grub both setup IMRs around compressed kernel, initrd memory
that need to be removed before the kernel hands out one of the IMR
encased addresses to a downstream DMA agent such as the SD or Ethernet.
IMRs on Galileo are setup to immediately reset the system on violation.
As a result if you're running a root filesystem from SD - you'll need
the boot-time IMRs torn down or you'll find seemingly random resets when
using your filesystem.
