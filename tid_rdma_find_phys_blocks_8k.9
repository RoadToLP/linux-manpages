.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "flow" 12
overall info for a TID RDMA segment

pointer to an array of page structs
.IP "npages" 12
number of pages

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This routine parses an array of pages to compute pagesets
in an 8k compatible way.

pages are tested two at a time, i, i + 1 for contiguous
pages and i - 1 and i contiguous pages.

If any condition is false, any accumlated pages are flushed and
v0,v1 are emitted as separate PAGE_SIZE pagesets

Otherwise, the current 8k is totaled for a future flush.
.SH "RETURN"
The number of pagesets
list set with the returned number of pagesets
