.SH NAME
i40e_vsi_stop_rings_no_wait \- Stop a VSI's rings and do not delay
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" i40e_vsi_stop_rings_no_wait
.BI "(struct i40e_vsi *vsi "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS

the VSI being shutdown
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function stops all the rings for a VSI but does not delay to verify
that rings have been disabled. It is expected that the caller is shutting
down multiple VSIs at once and will delay together for all the VSIs after
initiating the shutdown. This is particularly useful for shutting down lots
of VFs together. Otherwise, a large delay can be incurred while configuring
each VSI in serial.
