mma9551_gpio_config \- configure gpio
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" mma9551_gpio_config
.BI "(struct i2c_client *client "  ","
.BI "enum mma9551_gpio_pin pin "  ","
.BI "u8 app_id "  ","
.BI "u8 bitnum "  ","
.BI "int polarity "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "client" 12
I2C client
.IP "pin" 12
GPIO pin to configure
.IP "app_id" 12
Application ID
.IP "bitnum" 12
Bit number of status register being assigned to the GPIO pin.
.IP "polarity" 12
The polarity parameter is described in section 6.2.2, page 66,
of the Software Reference Manual.  Basically, polarity=0 means
the interrupt line has the same value as the selected bit,
while polarity=1 means the line is inverted.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Assign a bit from an applicationâ€™s status register to a specific GPIO pin.

Locking note: This function must be called with the device lock held.
Locking is not handled inside the function. Callers should ensure they
