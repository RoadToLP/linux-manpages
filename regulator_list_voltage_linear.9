.SH NAME
regulator_list_voltage_linear \- List voltages with simple calculation
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" regulator_list_voltage_linear
.BI "(struct regulator_dev *rdev "  ","
.BI "unsigned int selector "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "rdev" 12
Regulator device
.IP "selector" 12
Selector to convert into a voltage
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Regulators with a simple linear mapping between voltages and
selectors can set min_uV and uV_step in the regulator descriptor
and then use this function as their \fBlist_voltage\fP operation,
