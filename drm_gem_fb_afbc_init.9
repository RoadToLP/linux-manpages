.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" drm_gem_fb_afbc_init
.BI "(struct drm_device *dev "  ","
.BI "const struct drm_mode_fb_cmd2 *mode_cmd "  ","
.BI "struct drm_afbc_framebuffer *afbc_fb "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dev" 12
DRM device
.IP "mode_cmd" 12
Metadata from the userspace framebuffer creation request
.IP "afbc_fb" 12
afbc framebuffer
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function can be used by drivers which support afbc to complete
the preparation of struct drm_afbc_framebuffer. It must be called after
allocating the said struct and calling \fBdrm_gem_fb_init_with_funcs\fP.
It is caller's responsibility to put afbc_fb->base.obj objects in case
the call is unsuccessful.
.SH "RETURN"
Zero on success or a negative error value on failure.
