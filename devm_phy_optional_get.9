.SH NAME
devm_phy_optional_get \- lookup and obtain a reference to an optional phy.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "struct phy *" devm_phy_optional_get
.BI "(struct device *dev "  ","
.BI "const char *string "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dev" 12
device that requests this phy
.IP "string" 12
the phy name as given in the dt data or phy device name
for non-dt case
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Gets the phy using \fBphy_get\fP, and associates a device with it using
devres. On driver detach, release function is invoked on the devres
data, then, devres data is freed. This differs to \fBdevm_phy_get\fP in
that if the phy does not exist, it is not considered an error and
-ENODEV will not be returned. Instead the NULL phy is returned,
which can be passed to all other phy consumer calls.
