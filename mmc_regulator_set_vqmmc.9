io bus settings
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
For 3.3V signaling, we try to match VQMMC to VMMC as closely as possible.
That will match the behavior of old boards where VQMMC and VMMC were supplied
by the same supply.  The Bus Operating conditions for 3.3V signaling in the
SD card spec also define VQMMC in terms of VMMC.
If this is not possible we'll try the full 2.7-3.6V of the spec.

For 1.2V and 1.8V signaling we'll try to get as close as possible to the
requested voltage.  This is definitely a good idea for UHS where there's a
separate regulator on the card that's trying to make 1.8V and it's best if
we match.

This function is expected to be used by a controller's
\fBstart_signal_voltage_switch\fP function.
