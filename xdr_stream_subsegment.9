.SH NAME
xdr_stream_subsegment \- set @subbuf to a portion of @xdr
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "bool" xdr_stream_subsegment
.BI "(struct xdr_stream *xdr "  ","
.BI "struct xdr_buf *subbuf "  ","
.BI "unsigned int nbytes "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "xdr" 12
an xdr_stream set up for decoding
.IP "subbuf" 12
the result buffer
.IP "nbytes" 12
length of \fIxdr\fP to extract, in bytes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Sets up \fIsubbuf\fP to represent a portion of \fIxdr\fP. The portion
starts at the current offset in \fIxdr\fP, and extends for a length
of \fInbytes\fP. If this is successful, \fIxdr\fP is advanced to the next
position following that portion.

Return values:
true: \fIsubbuf\fP has been initialized, and \fIxdr\fP has been advanced.
false: a bounds error has occurred
