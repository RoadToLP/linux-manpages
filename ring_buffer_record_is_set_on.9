.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Returns true if the ring buffer is set writable by \fBring_buffer_record_on\fP.
Note that this does NOT mean it is in a writable state.

It may return true when the ring buffer has been disabled by
\fBring_buffer_record_disable\fP, as that is a temporary disabling of
the ring buffer.
