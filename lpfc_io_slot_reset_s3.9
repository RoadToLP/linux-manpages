.SH NAME
lpfc_io_slot_reset_s3 \- Method for restarting PCI SLI-3 device from scratch.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "pci_ers_result_t" lpfc_io_slot_reset_s3
.BI "(struct pci_dev *pdev "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "pdev" 12
pointer to PCI device.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This routine is called from the PCI subsystem for error handling to
device with SLI-3 interface spec. This is called after PCI bus has been
reset to restart the PCI card from scratch, as if from a cold-boot.
During the PCI subsystem error recovery, after driver returns
PCI_ERS_RESULT_NEED_RESET, the PCI subsystem will perform proper error
recovery and then call this routine before calling the .resume method
to recover the device. This function will initialize the HBA device,
enable the interrupt, but it will just put the HBA to offline state
without passing any I/O traffic.

Return codes
PCI_ERS_RESULT_RECOVERED - the device has been recovered
PCI_ERS_RESULT_DISCONNECT - device could not be recovered
