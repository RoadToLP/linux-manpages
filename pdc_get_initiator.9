.SH NAME
pdc_get_initiator \- Get the SCSI Interface Card params (SCSI ID, SDTR, SE or LVD)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" pdc_get_initiator
.BI "(struct hardware_path *hwpath "  ","
.BI "struct pdc_initiator *initiator "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "hwpath" 12
fully bc.mod style path to the device.
.IP "initiator" 12
the array to return the result into
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Get the SCSI operational parameters from PDC.
Needed since HPUX never used BIOS or symbios card NVRAM.
Most ncr/sym cards won't have an entry and just use whatever
capabilities of the card are (eg Ultra, LVD). But there are
several cases where it's useful:
o set SCSI id for Multi-initiator clusters,
o cable too long (ie SE scsi 10Mhz won't support 6m length),
o bus width exported is less than what the interface chip supports.
