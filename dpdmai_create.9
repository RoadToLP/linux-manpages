Create the DPDMAI object, allocate required resources and
perform required initialization.

The object can be created either by declaring it in the
DPL file, or by calling this function.

This function returns a unique authentication token,
associated with the specific object ID and the specific MC
portal; this token must be used in all subsequent calls to
this specific object. For objects that are created using the
DPL file, call \fBdpdmai_open\fP function to get an authentication
token first.

'0' on Success; Error code otherwise.
