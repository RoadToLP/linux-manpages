.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Populate clockdomain based on clock. It is needed for
\fBclkdm_deny_idle\fP and \fBclkdm_allow_idle\fP for blocking clockdomain
clockdomain idle during reset, enable and idle.

Note that we assume interconnect driver manages the clocks
and do not need to populate oh->_clk for dynamically
allocated modules.
