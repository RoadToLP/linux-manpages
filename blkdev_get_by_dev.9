.SH NAME
blkdev_get_by_dev \- open a block device by device number
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "struct block_device *" blkdev_get_by_dev
.BI "(dev_t dev "  ","
.BI "fmode_t mode "  ","
.BI "void *holder "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dev" 12
device number of block device to open
.IP "mode" 12
FMODE_* mask
.IP "holder" 12
exclusive holder identifier
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Open the block device described by device number \fIdev\fP. If \fImode\fP includes
FMODE_EXCL, the block device is opened with exclusive access.  Specifying
FMODE_EXCL with a NULL \fIholder\fP is invalid.  Exclusive opens may nest for
the same \fIholder\fP.

Use this interface ONLY if you really do not have anything better - i.e. when
you are behind a truly sucky interface and all you are given is a device
number.  Everything else should use \fBblkdev_get_by_path\fP.
.SH "CONTEXT"
Might sleep.
.SH "RETURN"
Reference to the block_device on success, ERR_PTR(-errno) on failure.
