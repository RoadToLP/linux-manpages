.SH NAME
nand_soft_waitrdy \- Poll STATUS reg until RDY bit is set to 1
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" nand_soft_waitrdy
.BI "(struct nand_chip *chip "  ","
.BI "unsigned long timeout_ms "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "chip" 12
NAND chip structure
.IP "timeout_ms" 12
Timeout in ms
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Poll the STATUS register using ->\fBexec_op\fP until the RDY bit becomes 1.
If that does not happen whitin the specified timeout, -ETIMEDOUT is
returned.

This helper is intended to be used when the controller does not have access
to the NAND R/B pin.

Be aware that calling this helper from an ->\fBexec_op\fP implementation means
->\fBexec_op\fP must be re-entrant.

Return 0 if the NAND chip is ready, a negative error otherwise.
