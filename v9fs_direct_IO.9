.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The presence of \fBv9fs_direct_IO\fP in the address space ops vector
allowes \fBopen\fP O_DIRECT flags which would have failed otherwise.

In the non-cached mode, we shunt off direct read and write requests before
the VFS gets them, so this method should never be called.

Direct IO is not 'yet' supported in the cached mode. Hence when
this routine is called through \fBgeneric_file_aio_read\fP, the read/write fails
with an error.
