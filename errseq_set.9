.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function sets the error in \fIeseq\fP, and increments the sequence counter
if the last sequence was sampled at some point in the past.

Any error set will always overwrite an existing error.

The previous value, primarily for debugging purposes. The
return value should not be used as a previously sampled value in later
calls as it will not have the SEEN flag set.
