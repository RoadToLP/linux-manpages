.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This routine removes the indicated qp from the
wait list if it is there.

This should be done after the hardware flow and
tid array resources have been allocated.

Must hold the qp s_lock and the rcd exp_lock.

It assumes the s_lock to protect the s_flags
field and to reliably test the HFI1_S_WAIT_TID_SPACE flag.
