.SH NAME
s5p_hash_final \- close up hash and calculate digest
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" s5p_hash_final
.BI "(struct ahash_request *req "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "req" 12
AHASH request
.SH "NOTE"
in final req->src do not have any data, and req->nbytes can be
non-zero.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
If there were no input data processed yet and the buffered hash data is
less than BUFLEN (64) then calculate the final hash immediately by using
SW algorithm fallback.

Otherwise enqueues the current AHASH request with OP_FINAL operation op
and finalize hash message in HW. Note that if digcnt!=0 then there were
previous update op, so there are always some buffered bytes in ctx->buffer,
which means that ctx->bufcnt!=0
.SH "RETURN"
0 if the request has been processed immediately,
-EINPROGRESS if the operation has been queued for later execution or is set
to processing by HW,
-EBUSY if queue is full and request should be resubmitted later,
other negative values denotes an error.
