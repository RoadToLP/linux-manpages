.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function drops all modeset locks taken by a previous call to the
\fBdrm_modeset_lock_all\fP function.

This function is deprecated. It uses the lock acquisition context stored
in \fIdrm_device.mode_config\fP. This facilitates conversion of existing
code because it removes the need to manually deal with the acquisition
context, but it is also brittle because the context is global and care must
be taken not to nest calls. New code should pass the acquisition context
directly to the \fBdrm_modeset_drop_locks\fP function.
