.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "phba" 12
pointer to lpfc hba data structure.
.IP "mdp" 12
pointer to the data structure to hold the derived model name.
.IP "descp" 12
pointer to the data structure to hold the derived description.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This routine retrieves HBA's description based on its registered PCI device
ID. The \fIdescp\fP passed into this function points to an array of 256 chars. It
shall be returned with the model name, maximum speed, and the host bus type.
The \fImdp\fP passed into this function points to an array of 80 chars. When the
