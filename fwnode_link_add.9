.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" fwnode_link_add
.BI "(struct fwnode_handle *con "  ","
.BI "struct fwnode_handle *sup "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "con" 12
Consumer end of the link.
.IP "sup" 12
Supplier end of the link.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Create a fwnode link between fwnode handles \fIcon\fP and \fIsup\fP. The fwnode link
represents the detail that the firmware lists \fIsup\fP fwnode as supplying a
resource to \fIcon\fP.

The driver core will use the fwnode link to create a device link between the
two device objects corresponding to \fIcon\fP and \fIsup\fP when they are created. The
driver core will automatically delete the fwnode link between \fIcon\fP and \fIsup\fP
after doing that.

Attempts to create duplicate links between the same pair of fwnode handles
are ignored and there is no reference counting.
