.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "vport" 12
Pointer to virtual port.
.IP "tgt_id" 12
SCSI ID of the target.
.IP "lun_id" 12
LUN ID of the scsi device.
.IP "abort_cmd" 12

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function sends an abort command for every SCSI command
associated with the given virtual port pending on the ring
filtered by lpfc_sli_validate_fcp_iocb function.
When abort_cmd == LPFC_CTX_LUN, the function sends abort only to the
FCP iocbs associated with lun specified by tgt_id and lun_id
parameters
When abort_cmd == LPFC_CTX_TGT, the function sends abort only to the
FCP iocbs associated with SCSI target specified by tgt_id parameter.
When abort_cmd == LPFC_CTX_HOST, the function sends abort to all
FCP iocbs associated with virtual port.
The pring used for SLI3 is sli3_ring[LPFC_FCP_RING], for SLI4
lpfc_sli4_calc_ring is used.
This function returns number of iocbs it failed to abort.
This function is called with no locks held.
