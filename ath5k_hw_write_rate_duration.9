.SH NAME
ath5k_hw_write_rate_duration \- Fill rate code to duration table
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" ath5k_hw_write_rate_duration
.BI "(struct ath5k_hw *ah "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "ah" 12
The \fIstruct ath5k_hw\fP
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Write the rate code to duration table upon hw reset. This is a helper for
\fBath5k_hw_pcu_init\fP. It seems all this is doing is setting an ACK timeout on
the hardware, based on current mode, for each rate. The rates which are
capable of short preamble (802.11b rates 2Mbps, 5.5Mbps, and 11Mbps) have
different rate code so we write their value twice (one for long preamble
and one for short).
.SH "NOTE"
Band doesn't matter here, if we set the values for OFDM it works
on both a and g modes. So all we have to do is set values for all g rates
that include all OFDM and CCK rates.
