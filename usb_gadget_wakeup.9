.SH NAME
usb_gadget_wakeup \- tries to wake up the host connected to this gadget
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" usb_gadget_wakeup
.BI "(struct usb_gadget *gadget "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gadget" 12
controller used to wake up the host
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Returns zero on success, else negative error code if the hardware
doesn't support such attempts, or its support has not been enabled
by the usb host.  Drivers must return device descriptors that report
their ability to support this, or hosts won't enable it.

This may also try to use SRP to wake the host and start enumeration,
even if OTG isn't otherwise in use.  OTG devices may also start
remote wakeup even when hosts don't explicitly enable it.
