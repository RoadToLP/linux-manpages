.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This interface can be used to configure the affinity management of
interrupts which have been allocated already.

There are certain limitations on when it may be used - attempts to use it
for when the kernel is configured for generic IRQ reservation mode (in
config GENERIC_IRQ_RESERVATION_MODE) will fail, as it may conflict with
managed/non-managed interrupt accounting. In addition, attempts to use it on
an interrupt which is already started or which has already been configured
as managed will also fail, as these mean invalid init state or double init.
