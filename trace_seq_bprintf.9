.SH NAME
trace_seq_bprintf \- Write the printf string from binary arguments
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" trace_seq_bprintf
.BI "(struct trace_seq *s "  ","
.BI "const char *fmt "  ","
.BI "const u32 *binary "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "s" 12
trace sequence descriptor
.IP "fmt" 12
The format string for the \fIbinary\fP arguments
.IP "binary" 12
The binary arguments for \fIfmt\fP.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
When recording in a fast path, a printf may be recorded with just
saving the format and the arguments as they were passed to the
function, instead of wasting cycles converting the arguments into
ASCII characters. Instead, the arguments are saved in a 32 bit
word array that is defined by the format string constraints.

This function will take the format and the binary array and finish
the conversion into the ASCII string within the buffer.
