.SH NAME
parport_wait_event \- wait for an event on a parallel port
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" parport_wait_event
.BI "(struct parport *port "  ","
.BI "signed long timeout "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "port" 12
port to wait on
.IP "timeout" 12
time to wait (in jiffies)

This function waits for up to \fItimeout\fP jiffies for an
interrupt to occur on a parallel port.  If the port timeout is
set to zero, it returns immediately.

If an interrupt occurs before the timeout period elapses, this
function returns zero immediately.  If it times out, it returns
one.  An error code less than zero indicates an error (most
likely a pending signal), and the calling code should finish
what it's doing as soon as it can.
