.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function enables the hardware interrupt handling, but leaves the hotplug
handling still disabled. It is called after \fBintel_irq_init\fP.

In the driver load and resume code we need working interrupts in a few places
but don't want to deal with the hassle of concurrent probe and hotplug
workers. Hence the split into this two-stage approach.
