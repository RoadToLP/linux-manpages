ib_unregister_driver \- Unregister all IB devices for a driver
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" ib_unregister_driver
.BI "(enum rdma_driver_id driver_id "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "driver_id" 12
The driver to unregister
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This implements a fence for device unregistration. It only returns once all
devices associated with the driver_id have fully completed their
unregistration and returned from ib_unregister_device*().

If device's are not yet unregistered it goes ahead and starts unregistering
them.

This does not block creation of new devices with the given driver_id, that
is the responsibility of the caller.
