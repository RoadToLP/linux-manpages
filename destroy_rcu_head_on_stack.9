.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function informs debugobjects that an on-stack rcu_head structure
is about to go out of scope.  As with \fBinit_rcu_head_on_stack\fP, this
function is not required for rcu_head structures that are statically
defined or that are dynamically allocated on the heap.  Also as with
\fBinit_rcu_head_on_stack\fP, this function has no effect for
!CONFIG_DEBUG_OBJECTS_RCU_HEAD kernel builds.
