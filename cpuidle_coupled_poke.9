.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" cpuidle_coupled_poke
.BI "(int cpu "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "cpu" 12
target cpu
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Ensures that the target cpu exits it's waiting idle state (if it is in it)
and will see updates to waiting_count before it re-enters it's waiting idle
state.

If cpuidle_coupled_poked_mask is already set for the target cpu, that cpu
either has or will soon have a pending IPI that will wake it out of idle,
or it is currently processing the IPI and is not in idle.
