.SH NAME
rpc_calc_rto \- Provide an estimated timeout value
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "unsigned long" rpc_calc_rto
.BI "(struct rpc_rtt *rt "  ","
.BI "unsigned int timer "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "rt" 12
context to use for calculation
.IP "timer" 12
timer array index (request type)
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Estimate RTO for an NFS RPC sent via an unreliable datagram.  Use
the mean and mean deviation of RTT for the appropriate type of RPC
for frequently issued RPCs, and a fixed default for the others.

The justification for doing "other" this way is that these RPCs
happen so infrequently that timer estimation would probably be
stale.  Also, since many of these RPCs are non-idempotent, a
conservative timeout is desired.
