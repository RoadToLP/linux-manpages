.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This routine is safe to be called with a a non-initialized context.
Also note that the routine conditionally checks for the existence
of the context control map before clearing the RHT registers and
context capabilities because it is possible to destroy a context
while the context is in the error state (previous mapping was
removed [so there is no need to worry about clearing] and context
is waiting for a new mapping).
