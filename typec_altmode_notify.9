.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The primary purpose for this function is to allow the alternate mode drivers
to tell which pin configuration has been negotiated with the partner. That
information will then be used for example to configure the muxes.
Communication to the other direction is also possible, and low level device
drivers can also send notifications to the alternate mode drivers. The actual
communication will be specific for every SVID.
