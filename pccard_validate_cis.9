.B "int" pccard_validate_cis
.BI "(struct pcmcia_socket *s "  ","

.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "s" 12
the struct pcmcia_socket we are to check
.IP "info" 12
returns the number of tuples in the (valid) CIS, or 0
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This tries to determine if a card has a sensible CIS.  In \fIinfo\fP, it
returns the number of tuples in the CIS, or 0 if the CIS looks bad. The
checks include making sure several critical tuples are present and
valid; seeing if the total number of tuples is reasonable; and
looking for tuples that use reserved codes.

The function returns 0 on success.
