.SH NAME
i915_perf_open_ioctl \- DRM ioctl() for userspace to open a stream FD
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" i915_perf_open_ioctl
.BI "(struct drm_device *dev "  ","
.BI "void *data "  ","
.BI "struct drm_file *file "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dev" 12
drm device
.IP "data" 12
ioctl data copied from userspace (unvalidated)
.IP "file" 12
drm file
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Validates the stream open parameters given by userspace including flags
and an array of u64 key, value pair properties.

Very little is assumed up front about the nature of the stream being
opened (for instance we don't assume it's for periodic OA unit metrics). An
i915-perf stream is expected to be a suitable interface for other forms of
buffered data written by the GPU besides periodic OA metrics.

Note we copy the properties from userspace outside of the i915 perf
mutex to avoid an awkward lockdep with mmap_lock.

Most of the implementation details are handled by
\fBi915_perf_open_ioctl_locked\fP after taking the \fIperf->lock\fP
mutex for serializing with any non-file-operation driver hooks.
.SH "RETURN"
A newly opened i915 Perf stream file descriptor or negative
error code on failure.
