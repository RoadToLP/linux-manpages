.SH NAME
spi_setup \- setup SPI mode and clock rate
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" spi_setup
.BI "(struct spi_device *spi "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "spi" 12
the device whose settings are being modified
.SH "CONTEXT"
can sleep, and no requests are queued to the device
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
SPI protocol drivers may need to update the transfer mode if the
device doesn't work with its default.  They may likewise need
to update clock rates or word sizes from initial values.  This function
changes those settings, and must be called from a context that can sleep.
Except for SPI_CS_HIGH, which takes effect immediately, the changes take
effect the next time the device is selected and data is transferred to
or from it.  When this function returns, the spi device is deselected.

Note that this call will fail if the protocol driver specifies an option
that the underlying controller or its driver does not support.  For
example, not all hardware supports wire transfers using nine bit words,
LSB-first wire encoding, or active-high chipselects.
.SH "RETURN"
zero on success, else a negative error code.
