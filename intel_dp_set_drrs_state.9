.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function gets called when refresh rate (RR) has to be changed from
one frequency to another. Switches can be between high and low RR
supported by the panel or to any other RR based on media playback (in
this case, RR value needs to be passed from user space).

The caller of this function needs to take a lock on dev_priv->drrs.
