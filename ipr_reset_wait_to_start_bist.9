.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function waits for adapter permission to run BIST,
then runs BIST. If the adapter does not give permission after a
reasonable time, we will reset the adapter anyway. The impact of
resetting the adapter without warning the adapter is the risk of
losing the persistent error log on the adapter. If the adapter is
reset while it is writing to the flash on the adapter, the flash
segment will have bad ECC and be zeroed.

Return value:
IPR_RC_JOB_CONTINUE / IPR_RC_JOB_RETURN
