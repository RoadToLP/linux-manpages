.SH NAME
pid_controller \- PID controller
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "u32" pid_controller
.BI "(struct thermal_zone_device *tz "  ","
.BI "int control_temp "  ","
.BI "u32 max_allocatable_power "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "tz" 12
thermal zone we are operating in
.IP "control_temp" 12
the target temperature in millicelsius
.IP "max_allocatable_power" 12
maximum allocatable power for this thermal zone
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This PID controller increases the available power budget so that the
temperature of the thermal zone gets as close as possible to
\fIcontrol_temp\fP and limits the power if it exceeds it.  k_po is the
proportional term when we are overshooting, k_pu is the
proportional term when we are undershooting.  integral_cutoff is a
threshold below which we stop accumulating the error.  The
accumulated error is only valid if the requested power will make
the system warmer.  If the system is mostly idle, there's no point
in accumulating positive error.
.SH "RETURN"
The power budget for the next period.
