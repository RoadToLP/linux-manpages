.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Also address the case where we are pulling data in on pages only
and as such no data is present in the skb header.

In addition if skb is not at least 60 bytes we need to pad it so that
it is large enough to qualify as a valid Ethernet frame.

Returns true if an error was encountered and skb was freed.
