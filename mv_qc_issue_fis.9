.SH NAME
mv_qc_issue_fis \- Issue a command directly as a FIS
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "unsigned int" mv_qc_issue_fis
.BI "(struct ata_queued_cmd *qc "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "qc" 12
queued command to start

Note that the ATA shadow registers are not updated
after command issue, so the device will appear "READY"
if polled, even while it is BUSY processing the command.

So we use a status hook to fake ATA_BUSY until the drive changes state.
.SH "NOTE"
we don't get updated shadow regs on *completion*
of non-data commands. So avoid sending them via this function,
as they will appear to have completed immediately.

GEN_IIE has special registers that we could get the result tf from,
but earlier chipsets do not.  For now, we ignore those registers.
