.SH NAME
drm_atomic_get_old_connector_for_encoder \- Get old connector for an encoder
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "struct drm_connector *" drm_atomic_get_old_connector_for_encoder
.BI "(struct drm_atomic_state *state "  ","
.BI "struct drm_encoder *encoder "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "state" 12
Atomic state
.IP "encoder" 12
The encoder to fetch the connector state for
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function finds and returns the connector that was connected to \fIencoder\fP
as specified by the \fIstate\fP.

If there is no connector in \fIstate\fP which previously had \fIencoder\fP connected to
it, this function will return NULL. While this may seem like an invalid use
case, it is sometimes useful to differentiate commits which had no prior
connectors attached to \fIencoder\fP vs ones that did (and to inspect their
state). This is especially true in enable hooks because the pipeline has
changed.
.SH "RETURN"
The old connector connected to \fIencoder\fP, or NULL if the encoder is
not connected.
