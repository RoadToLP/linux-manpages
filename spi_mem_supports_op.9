.SH NAME
spi_mem_supports_op \- Check if a memory device and the controller it is connected to support a specific memory operation
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "bool" spi_mem_supports_op
.BI "(struct spi_mem *mem "  ","
.BI "const struct spi_mem_op *op "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "mem" 12
the SPI memory
.IP "op" 12
the memory operation to check
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Some controllers are only supporting Single or Dual IOs, others might only
support specific opcodes, or it can even be that the controller and device
both support Quad IOs but the hardware prevents you from using it because
only 2 IO lines are connected.

This function checks whether a specific operation is supported.
.SH "RETURN"
true if \fIop\fP is supported, false otherwise.
