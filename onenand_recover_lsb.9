.SH "DESCRIPTION"
MLC NAND Flash cell has paired pages - LSB page and MSB page. LSB page has
lower page address and MSB page has higher page address in paired pages.
If power off occurs during MSB page program, the paired LSB page data can
become corrupt. LSB page recovery read is a way to read LSB page though page
data are corrupted. When uncorrectable error occurs as a result of LSB page
read after power up, issue LSB page recovery read.
