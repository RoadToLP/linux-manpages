.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Since the hardware frontbuffer tracking has gaps we need to integrate
with the software frontbuffer tracking. This function gets called every
time frontbuffer rendering starts and a buffer gets dirtied. PSR must be
disabled if the frontbuffer mask contains a buffer relevant to PSR.

Dirty frontbuffers relevant to PSR are tracked in busy_frontbuffer_bits."
