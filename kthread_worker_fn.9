.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function implements the main cycle of kthread worker. It processes
work_list until it is stopped with \fBkthread_stop\fP. It sleeps when the queue
is empty.

The works are not allowed to keep any locks, disable preemption or interrupts
when they finish. There is defined a safe point for freezing when one work
finishes and before a new one is started.

Also the works must not be handled by more than one worker at the same time,
see also \fBkthread_queue_work\fP.
