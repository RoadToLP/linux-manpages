.SH NAME
nx_build_sg_lists \- walk the input scatterlists and build arrays of NX scatterlists based on them.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" nx_build_sg_lists
.BI "(struct nx_crypto_ctx *nx_ctx "  ","
.BI "const u8 *iv "  ","
.BI "struct scatterlist *dst "  ","
.BI "struct scatterlist *src "  ","
.BI "unsigned int *nbytes "  ","
.BI "unsigned int offset "  ","
.BI "u8 *oiv "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "nx_ctx" 12
NX crypto context for the lists we're building
.IP "iv" 12
iv data, if the algorithm requires it
.IP "dst" 12
destination scatterlist
.IP "src" 12
source scatterlist
.IP "nbytes" 12
length of data described in the scatterlists
.IP "offset" 12
number of bytes to fast-forward past at the beginning of
scatterlists.
.IP "oiv" 12
destination for the iv data, if the algorithm requires it
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This is common code shared by all the AES algorithms. It uses the crypto
scatterlist walk routines to traverse input and output scatterlists, building
corresponding NX scatterlists
