.SH NAME
lpfc_rscn_disc \- Perform rscn discovery for a vport
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" lpfc_rscn_disc
.BI "(struct lpfc_vport *vport "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "vport" 12
pointer to a host virtual N_Port data structure.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This routine performs Registration State Change Notification (RSCN)
discovery for a \fIvport\fP. If the \fIvport\fP's node port recovery count is not
zero, it will invoke the \fBlpfc_els_disc_plogi\fP to perform PLOGI for all
the nodes that need recovery. If none of the PLOGI were needed through
the \fBlpfc_els_disc_plogi\fP routine, the \fBlpfc_end_rscn\fP routine shall be
invoked to check and handle possible more RSCN came in during the period
of processing the current ones.
