.SH NAME
ice_read_flat_nvm \- Read portion of NVM by flat offset
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "enum ice_status" ice_read_flat_nvm
.BI "(struct ice_hw *hw "  ","
.BI "u32 offset "  ","
.BI "u32 *length "  ","
.BI "u8 *data "  ","
.BI "bool read_shadow_ram "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "hw" 12
pointer to the HW struct
.IP "offset" 12
offset from beginning of NVM
.IP "length" 12
(in) number of bytes to read; (out) number of bytes actually read
.IP "data" 12
buffer to return data in (sized to fit the specified length)
.IP "read_shadow_ram" 12
if true, read from shadow RAM instead of NVM
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Reads a portion of the NVM, as a flat memory space. This function correctly
breaks read requests across Shadow RAM sectors and ensures that no single
read request exceeds the maximum 4KB read for a single AdminQ command.

Returns a status code on failure. Note that the data pointer may be
partially updated if some reads succeed before a failure.
