pointer to an error code return

The file handle passed in is locked and the socket it is bound
to is returned. If an error occurs the err pointer is overwritten
with a negative errno code and NULL is returned. The function checks
for both invalid handles and passing a handle which is not a socket.

On a success the socket object pointer is returned.
