.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This routine walks the list of buffers that have been allocated and
repost them to the port by using SGL block post. This is needed after a
pci_function_reset/warm_start or start. It attempts to construct blocks
of buffer sgls which contains contiguous xris and uses the non-embedded
SGL block post mailbox commands to post them to the port. For single
buffer sgl with non-contiguous xri, if any, it shall use embedded SGL post
mailbox command for posting.
.SH "RETURN"
0 = success, non-zero failure.
