.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Create a device node or file.

If the inode has been found through an idmapped mount the user namespace of
the vfsmount must be passed through \fImnt_userns\fP. This function will then take
care to map the inode according to \fImnt_userns\fP before checking permissions.
On non-idmapped mounts or if permission checking is to be performed on the
raw inode simply passs init_user_ns.
