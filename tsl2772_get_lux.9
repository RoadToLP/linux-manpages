tsl2772_get_lux \- Reads and calculates current lux value.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" tsl2772_get_lux
.BI "(struct iio_dev *indio_dev "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS

pointer to IIO device
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The raw ch0 and ch1 values of the ambient light sensed in the last
integration cycle are read from the device. The raw values are multiplied
by a device-specific scale factor, and divided by the integration time and
device gain. The code supports multiple lux equations through the lux table
coefficients. A lux gain trim is applied to each lux equation, and then the
maximum lux within the interval 0..65535 is selected.
