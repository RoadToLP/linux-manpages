.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Hook to simulate corrupt/invalid data being sent from host (driver) to EC.
Causes the packet data to be actively corrupted by overwriting it with
pre-defined values, such that it becomes invalid, causing the EC to respond
with a NAK packet. Useful to test handling of NAK packets received by the
driver.
