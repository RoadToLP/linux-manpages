.SH "NOTES"
We don't want to use the normal command completion while we are are
still handling errors - it may cause other commands to be queued,
and that would disturb what we are doing.  Thus we really want to
keep a list of pending commands for final completion, and once we
are ready to leave error handling we handle completion for real.
