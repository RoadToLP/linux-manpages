.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "kobj" 12
The kernel object \fIattr\fP is associated with.
.IP "attr" 12
The attribute to break the "active" protection for.

With sysfs, just like kernfs, deletion of an attribute is postponed until
all active .\fBshow\fP and .\fBstore\fP callbacks have finished unless this function
is called. Hence this function is useful in methods that implement self
deletion.
