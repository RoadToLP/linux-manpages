.SH NAME
pcpu_alloc_area \- allocates an area from a pcpu_chunk
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" pcpu_alloc_area
.BI "(struct pcpu_chunk *chunk "  ","
.BI "int alloc_bits "  ","
.BI "size_t align "  ","
.BI "int start "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "chunk" 12
chunk of interest
.IP "alloc_bits" 12
size of request in allocation units
.IP "align" 12
alignment of area (max PAGE_SIZE)
.IP "start" 12
bit_off to start searching
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function takes in a \fIstart\fP offset to begin searching to fit an
allocation of \fIalloc_bits\fP with alignment \fIalign\fP.  It needs to scan
the allocation map because if it fits within the block's contig hint,
\fIstart\fP will be block->first_free. This is an attempt to fill the
allocation prior to breaking the contig hint.  The allocation and
boundary maps are updated accordingly if it confirms a valid
free area.
.SH "RETURN"
Allocated addr offset in \fIchunk\fP on success.
-1 if no matching area is found.
