.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This is a combination of \fBclk_set_rate\fP and \fBclk_rate_exclusive_get\fP
within a critical section

This can be used initially to ensure that at least 1 consumer is
satisfied when several consumers are competing for exclusivity over the
same clock provider.

The exclusivity is not applied if setting the rate failed.

Calls to \fBclk_rate_exclusive_get\fP should be balanced with calls to
\fBclk_rate_exclusive_put\fP.

Returns 0 on success, -EERROR otherwise.
