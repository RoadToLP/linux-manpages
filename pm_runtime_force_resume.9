.SH NAME
pm_runtime_force_resume \- Force a device into resume state if needed.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" pm_runtime_force_resume
.BI "(struct device *dev "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dev" 12
Device to resume.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Prior invoking this function we expect the user to have brought the device
into low power state by a call to \fBpm_runtime_force_suspend\fP. Here we reverse
those actions and bring the device into full power, if it is expected to be
used on system resume.  In the other case, we defer the resume to be managed
via runtime PM.

Typically this function may be invoked from a system resume callback.
