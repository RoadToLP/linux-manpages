.SH NAME
ice_rebuild \- rebuild after reset
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" ice_rebuild
.BI "(struct ice_pf *pf "  ","
.BI "enum ice_reset_req reset_type "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "pf" 12
PF to rebuild
.IP "reset_type" 12
type of reset
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Do not rebuild VF VSI in this flow because that is already handled via
\fBice_reset_all_vfs\fP. This is because requirements for resetting a VF after a
PFR/CORER/GLOBER/etc. are different than the normal flow. Also, we don't want
to reset/rebuild all the VF VSI twice.
