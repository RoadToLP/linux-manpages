.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" dwc2_gadget_handle_nak
.BI "(struct dwc2_hsotg_ep *hs_ep "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "hs_ep" 12
The endpoint on which interrupt is asserted.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This is starting point for ISOC-IN transfer, synchronization done with
first IN token received from host while corresponding EP is disabled.

Device does not know when first one token will arrive from host. On first
token arrival HW generates 2 interrupts: 'in token received while FIFO empty'
and 'NAK'. NAK interrupt for ISOC-IN means that token has arrived and ZLP was
sent in response to that as there was no data in FIFO. SW is basing on this
interrupt to obtain frame in which token has come and then based on the
interval calculates next frame for transfer.
