.SH "DESCRIPTION"
If \fInscans\fP is 0, it is set to the number of scans available in the
async buffer.

If the async command has a stop_src of TRIG_COUNT, the \fInscans\fP will be
checked against the number of scans remaining to complete the command.

The return value will then be either the expected number of scans or the
number of scans remaining to complete the command, whichever is fewer.
