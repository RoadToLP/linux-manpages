The VMID to check
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
return true if there is a new generation of VMIDs being used

The hardware supports a limited set of values with the value zero reserved
for the host, so we check if an assigned value belongs to a previous
generation, which requires us to assign a new value. If we're the first to
use a VMID for the new generation, we must flush necessary caches and TLBs
on all CPUs.
