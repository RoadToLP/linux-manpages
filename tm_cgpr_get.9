.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function gets transaction checkpointed GPR registers.

When the transaction is active, 'ckpt_regs' holds all the checkpointed
GPR register values for the current transaction to fall back on if it
aborts in between. This function gets those checkpointed GPR registers.
The userspace interface buffer layout is as follows.

struct data {
struct pt_regs ckpt_regs;
};
