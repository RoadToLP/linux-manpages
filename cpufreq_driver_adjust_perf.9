.SH NAME
cpufreq_driver_adjust_perf \- Adjust CPU performance level in one go.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" cpufreq_driver_adjust_perf
.BI "(unsigned int cpu "  ","
.BI "unsigned long min_perf "  ","
.BI "unsigned long target_perf "  ","
.BI "unsigned long capacity "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "cpu" 12
Target CPU.
.IP "min_perf" 12
Minimum (required) performance level (units of \fIcapacity\fP).
.IP "target_perf" 12
Target (desired) performance level (units of \fIcapacity\fP).
.IP "capacity" 12
Capacity of the target CPU.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Carry out a fast performance level switch of \fIcpu\fP without sleeping.

The driver's ->\fBadjust_perf\fP callback invoked by this function must be
suitable for being called from within RCU-sched read-side critical sections
and it is expected to select a suitable performance level equal to or above
\fImin_perf\fP and preferably equal to or below \fItarget_perf\fP.

This function must not be called if policy->fast_switch_enabled is unset.

Governors calling this function must guarantee that it will never be invoked
twice in parallel for the same CPU and that it will never be called in
parallel with either ->\fBtarget\fP or ->\fBtarget_index\fP or ->\fBfast_switch\fP for
the same CPU.
