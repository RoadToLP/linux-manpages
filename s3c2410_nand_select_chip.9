.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This is called by the MTD layer to either select a given chip for the
\fImtd\fP instance, or to indicate that the access has finished and the
chip can be de-selected.

The routine ensures that the nFCE line is correctly setup, and any
platform specific selection code is called to route nFCE to the specific
chip.
