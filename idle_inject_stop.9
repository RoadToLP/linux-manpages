.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The function stops idle injection and waits for the threads to finish work.
If CPU idle time is being injected when this function runs, then it will
wait until the end of the cycle.

When it returns, there is no more idle injection kthread activity.  The
kthreads are scheduled out and the periodic timer is off.
