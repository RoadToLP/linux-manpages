.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "s32" e1000_set_lplu_state_pchlan
.BI "(struct e1000_hw *hw "  ","
.BI "bool active "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "hw" 12
pointer to the HW structure
.IP "active" 12
true to enable LPLU, false to disable

Sets the LPLU state according to the active flag.  For PCH, if OEM write
bit are disabled in the NVM, writing the LPLU bits in the MAC will not set
the phy speed. This function will manually set the LPLU bit and restart
auto-neg as hw would do. D3 and D0 LPLU will call the same function
since it configures the same bit.
