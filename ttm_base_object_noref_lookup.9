.SH NAME
ttm_base_object_noref_lookup \- look up a base object without reference
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "struct ttm_base_object *" ttm_base_object_noref_lookup
.BI "(struct ttm_object_file *tfile "  ","
.BI "uint32_t key "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "tfile" 12
The struct ttm_object_file the object is registered with.
.IP "key" 12
The object handle.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function looks up a ttm base object and returns a pointer to it
without refcounting the pointer. The returned pointer is only valid
until \fBttm_base_object_noref_release\fP is called, and the object
pointed to by the returned pointer may be doomed. Any persistent usage
of the object requires a refcount to be taken using \fBkref_get_unless_zero\fP.
Iff this function returns successfully it needs to be paired with
\fBttm_base_object_noref_release\fP and no sleeping- or scheduling functions
may be called inbetween these function callse.
.SH "RETURN"
A pointer to the object if successful or NULL otherwise.
