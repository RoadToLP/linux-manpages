.SH NAME
mock_drm_getfile \- Create a new struct file for the drm device
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "struct file *" mock_drm_getfile
.BI "(struct drm_minor *minor "  ","
.BI "unsigned int flags "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "minor" 12
drm minor to wrap (e.g. #drm_device.primary)
.IP "flags" 12

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This create a new struct file that wraps a DRM file context around a
DRM minor. This mimicks userspace opening e.g. /dev/dri/card0, but without
invoking userspace. The struct file may be operated on using its f_op
(the drm_device.driver.fops) to mimick userspace operations, or be supplied
to userspace facing functions as an internal/anonymous client.
.SH "RETURN"
Pointer to newly created struct file, ERR_PTR on failure.
