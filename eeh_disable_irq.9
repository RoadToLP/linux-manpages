.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This routine must be called when reporting temporary or permanent
error to the particular PCI device to disable interrupt of that
device. If the device has enabled MSI or MSI-X interrupt, we needn't
do real work because EEH should freeze DMA transfers for those PCI
devices encountering EEH errors, which includes MSI or MSI-X.
