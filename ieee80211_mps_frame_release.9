.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
For peers if we have individually-addressed frames buffered or the peer
indicates buffered frames, send a corresponding MPSP trigger frame. Since
we do not evaluate the awake window duration, QoS Nulls are used as MPSP
trigger frames. If the neighbour STA is not a peer, only send single frames.
