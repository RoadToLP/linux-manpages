pointer to the spi controller data structure
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
RX-Fifo is flushed when SPI controller is disabled. To prevent any data
loss, use stm32h7_spi_read_rxfifo(flush) to read the remaining bytes in
RX-Fifo.
Normally, if TSIZE has been configured, we should relax the hardware at the
reception of the EOT interrupt. But in case of error, EOT will not be
raised. So the subsystem unprepare_message call allows us to properly
complete the transfer from an hardware point of view.
