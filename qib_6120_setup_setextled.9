.SH NAME
qib_6120_setup_setextled \- set the state of the two external LEDs
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" qib_6120_setup_setextled
.BI "(struct qib_pportdata *ppd "  ","
.BI "u32 on "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "ppd" 12
the qlogic_ib device
.IP "on" 12
whether the link is up or not
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The exact combo of LEDs if on is true is determined by looking
at the ibcstatus.
These LEDs indicate the physical and logical state of IB link.
For this chip (at least with recommended board pinouts), LED1
is Yellow (logical state) and LED2 is Green (physical state),
.SH "NOTE"
We try to match the Mellanox HCA LED behavior as best
we can.  Green indicates physical link state is OK (something is
plugged in, and we can train).
Amber indicates the link is logically up (ACTIVE).
Mellanox further blinks the amber LED to indicate data packet
activity, but we have no hardware support for that, so it would
require waking up every 10-20 msecs and checking the counters
on the chip, and then turning the LED off if appropriate.  That's
visible overhead, so not something we will do.
