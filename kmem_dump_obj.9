.SH NAME
kmem_dump_obj \- Print available slab provenance information
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" kmem_dump_obj
.BI "(void *object "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "object" 12
slab object for which to find provenance information.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function uses \fBpr_cont\fP, so that the caller is expected to have
printed out whatever preamble is appropriate.  The provenance information
depends on the type of object and on how much debugging is enabled.
For a slab-cache object, the fact that it is a slab object is printed,
and, if available, the slab name, return address, and stack trace from
the allocation of that object.

This function will splat if passed a pointer to a non-slab object.
If you are not sure what type of object you have, you should instead
use \fBmem_dump_obj\fP.
