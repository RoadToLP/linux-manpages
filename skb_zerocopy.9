.SH NAME
skb_zerocopy \- Zero copy skb to skb
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" skb_zerocopy
.BI "(struct sk_buff *to "  ","
.BI "struct sk_buff *from "  ","
.BI "int len "  ","
.BI "int hlen "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "to" 12
destination buffer
.IP "from" 12
source buffer
.IP "len" 12
number of bytes to copy from source buffer
.IP "hlen" 12
size of linear headroom in destination buffer

Copies up to `len` bytes from `from` to `to` by creating references
to the frags in the source buffer.

The `hlen` as calculated by \fBskb_zerocopy_headlen\fP specifies the
headroom in the `to` buffer.

Return value:
0: everything is OK
-ENOMEM: couldn't orphan frags of \fIfrom\fP due to lack of memory
-EFAULT: \fBskb_copy_bits\fP found some problem with skb geometry
