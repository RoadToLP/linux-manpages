sk_buff to get the payload offset from
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The function will get the offset to the payload as far as it could
be dissected.  The main user is currently BPF, so that we can dynamically
truncate packets without needing to push actual payload to the user
space and can analyze headers only, instead.
