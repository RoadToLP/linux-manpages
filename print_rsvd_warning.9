.SH NAME
print_rsvd_warning \- warn about not having enough reserved PEBs.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" print_rsvd_warning
.BI "(struct ubi_device *ubi "  ","
.BI "struct ubi_attach_info *ai "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "ubi" 12
UBI device description object
.IP "ai" 12
UBI attach info object
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This is a helper function for '\fBubi_eba_init\fP' which is called when UBI
cannot reserve enough PEBs for bad block handling. This function makes a
decision whether we have to print a warning or not. The algorithm is as
follows:
o if this is a new UBI image, then just print the warning
o if this is an UBI image which has already been used for some time, print
a warning only if we can reserve less than 10% of the expected amount of
the reserved PEB.

The idea is that when UBI is used, PEBs become bad, and the reserved pool
of PEBs becomes smaller, which is normal and we do not want to scare users
with a warning every time they attach the MTD device. This was an issue
reported by real users.
