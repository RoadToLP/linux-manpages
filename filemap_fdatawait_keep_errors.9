.SH NAME
filemap_fdatawait_keep_errors \- wait for writeback without clearing errors
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" filemap_fdatawait_keep_errors
.BI "(struct address_space *mapping "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "mapping" 12
address space structure to wait for
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Walk the list of under-writeback pages of the given address space
and wait for all of them.  Unlike \fBfilemap_fdatawait\fP, this function
does not clear error status of the address space.

Use this function if callers don't handle errors themselves.  Expected
call sites are system-wide / filesystem-wide data flushers: e.g. sync(2),
fsfreeze(8)
.SH "RETURN"
error status of the address space.
