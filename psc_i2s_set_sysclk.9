.SH NAME
psc_i2s_set_sysclk \- set the clock frequency and direction
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" psc_i2s_set_sysclk
.BI "(struct snd_soc_dai *cpu_dai "  ","
.BI "int clk_id "  ","
.BI "unsigned int freq "  ","
.BI "int dir "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "cpu_dai" 12
-- undescribed --
.IP "clk_id" 12
reserved, should be zero
.IP "freq" 12
the frequency of the given clock ID, currently ignored
.IP "dir" 12
SND_SOC_CLOCK_IN (clock slave) or SND_SOC_CLOCK_OUT (clock master)
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

This function is called by the machine driver to tell us what the clock
frequency and direction are.

Currently, we only support operating as a clock slave (SND_SOC_CLOCK_IN),
and we don't care about the frequency.  Return an error if the direction
is not SND_SOC_CLOCK_IN.
