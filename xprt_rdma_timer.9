.SH NAME
xprt_rdma_timer \- invoked when an RPC times out
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" xprt_rdma_timer
.BI "(struct rpc_xprt *xprt "  ","
.BI "struct rpc_task *task "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "xprt" 12
controlling RPC transport
.IP "task" 12
RPC task that timed out
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Invoked when the transport is still connected, but an RPC
retransmit timeout occurs.

Since RDMA connections don't have a keep-alive, forcibly
disconnect and retry to connect. This drives full
detection of the network path, and retransmissions of
all pending RPCs.
