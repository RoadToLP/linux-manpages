timer context used to obtain the pointer to lpfc hba data structure.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This is the HBA-timer timeout handler registered to the lpfc driver. When
this timer fires, a HBA timeout event shall be posted to the lpfc driver
work-port-events bitmap and the worker thread is notified. This timeout
event will be used by the worker thread to invoke the actual timeout
handler routine, lpfc_hb_timeout_handler. Any periodical operations will
be performed in the timeout handler and the HBA timeout event bit shall
be cleared by the worker thread after it has taken the event bitmap out.
