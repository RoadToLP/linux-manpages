Update the mtime and ctime members of an inode and mark the inode
for writeback.  Note that this function is meant exclusively for
usage in the file write path of filesystems, and filesystems may
choose to explicitly ignore update via this function with the
S_NOCMTIME inode flag, e.g. for network filesystem where these
timestamps are handled by the server.  This can return an error for
file systems who need to allocate space in order to update an inode.
