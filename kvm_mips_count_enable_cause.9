.SH NAME
kvm_mips_count_enable_cause \- Enable count using CP0_Cause.DC.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" kvm_mips_count_enable_cause
.BI "(struct kvm_vcpu *vcpu "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "vcpu" 12
Virtual CPU.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Enable the CP0_Count timer and clear CP0_Cause.DC. A timer interrupt after
the start time will be handled if the timer isn't disabled by count_ctl.DC,
potentially before even returning, so the caller should be careful with
ordering of CP0_Cause modifications so as not to lose it.

Assumes CP0_Cause.DC is set (count disabled).
