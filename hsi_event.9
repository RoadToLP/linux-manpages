Clients should not be concerned about wake line behavior. However, due
to a race condition in HSI HW protocol, clients need to be notified
about wake line changes, so they can implement a workaround for it.

Events:
HSI_EVENT_START_RX - Incoming wake line high
HSI_EVENT_STOP_RX - Incoming wake line down

Returns -errno on error, or 0 on success.
