.SH NAME
get_dump_page \- pin user page in memory while writing it to core dump
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "struct page *" get_dump_page
.BI "(unsigned long addr "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS

user address
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Returns struct page pointer of user page pinned for dump,
to be freed afterwards by \fBput_page\fP.

Returns NULL on any kind of failure - a hole must then be inserted into
the corefile, to preserve alignment with its headers; and also returns
NULL wherever the ZERO_PAGE, or an anonymous pte_none, has been found -
allowing a hole to be left in the corefile to save diskspace.

Called without mmap_lock (takes and releases the mmap_lock by itself).
