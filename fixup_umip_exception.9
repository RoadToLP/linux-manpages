.SH NAME
fixup_umip_exception \- Fixup a general protection fault caused by UMIP
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "bool" fixup_umip_exception
.BI "(struct pt_regs *regs "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "regs" 12
Registers as saved when entering the #GP handler
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The instructions SGDT, SIDT, STR, SMSW and SLDT cause a general protection
fault if executed with CPL > 0 (i.e., from user space). This function fixes
the exception up and provides dummy results for SGDT, SIDT and SMSW; STR
and SLDT are not fixed up.

If operands are memory addresses, results are copied to user-space memory as
indicated by the instruction pointed by eIP using the registers indicated in
the instruction operands. If operands are registers, results are copied into
the context that was saved when entering kernel mode.

True if emulation was successful; false if not.
.SH "RETURN"
