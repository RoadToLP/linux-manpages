.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" usb_function_deactivate
.BI "(struct usb_function *function "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "function" 12
the function that isn't yet ready to respond
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Blocks response of the gadget driver to host enumeration by
preventing the data line pullup from being activated.  This is
normally called during \fI\fP\fBbind\fP processing to change from the
initial "ready to respond" state, or when a required resource
becomes available.

For example, drivers that serve as a passthrough to a userspace
daemon can block enumeration unless that daemon (such as an OBEX,
MTP, or print server) is ready to handle host requests.

Not all systems support software control of their USB peripheral
data pullups.

Returns zero on success, else negative errno.
