.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "in" 12
input buffer pointer
.IP "inlen" 12
input buffer size
.IP "out" 12
output buffer pointer
.IP "outlenp" 12
output buffer size pointer
.IP "workmem" 12
working memory buffer pointer, size determined by

.SH "DESCRIPTION"

(De)compression provided by the NX842 coprocessor on IBM PowerNV systems.
This compresses or decompresses the provided input buffer into the provided
output buffer.

Upon return from this function \fIoutlen\fP contains the length of the
output data.  If there is an error then \fIoutlen\fP will be 0 and an
error will be specified by the return code from this function.

The \fIworkmem\fP buffer should only be used by one function call at a time.
.SH "RETURN"
0          Success, output of length \fIoutlenp\fP stored in the buffer at \fIout\fP
-ENODEV    Hardware unavailable
-ENOSPC    Output buffer is to small
-EMSGSIZE  Input buffer too large
-EINVAL    buffer constraints do not fix nx842_constraints
-EPROTO    hardware error during operation
-ETIMEDOUT hardware did not complete operation in reasonable time
-EINTR     operation was aborted
