.SH NAME
bfq_entity_of \- get an entity from a node.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "struct bfq_entity *" bfq_entity_of
.BI "(struct rb_node *node "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS

the node field of the entity.

Convert a node pointer to the relative entity.  This is used only
to simplify the logic of some functions and not as the generic
conversion mechanism because, e.g., in the tree walking functions,
the check for a NULL value would be redundant.
