.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "shost" 12
SCSI host of command to be sent
.IP "cmd" 12
SCSI command to be sent

In some cases, this function translates SCSI commands into
ATA taskfiles, and queues the taskfiles to be sent to
hardware.  In other cases, this function simulates a
SCSI device by evaluating and responding to certain
SCSI commands.  This creates the overall effect of
ATA and ATAPI devices appearing as SCSI devices.

LOCKING:
ATA host lock
.SH "RETURN"
Return value from \fB__ata_scsi_queuecmd\fP if \fIcmd\fP can be queued,
0 otherwise.
