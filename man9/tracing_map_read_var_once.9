.SH NAME
tracing_map_read_var_once \- Return and reset a tracing_map_elt's variable field
.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "elt" 12
The tracing_map_elt
.IP "i" 12
The index of the given variable associated with the tracing_map_elt
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Retrieve the value of the variable i associated with the specified
tracing_map_elt instance, and reset the variable to the 'not set'
state.  The index i is the index returned by the call to
\fBtracing_map_add_var\fP when the tracing map was set up.  The reset
essentially makes the variable a read-once variable if it's only
accessed using this function.
.SH "RETURN"
The variable value associated with field i for elt.
