FW event log sequence numbers information
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
FW maintains a log of all events in a non-volatile area. Upper layers would
usually find out the latest sequence number of the events, the seq number at
the boot etc. They would "read" all the events below the latest seq number
by issuing a direct fw cmd (DCMD). For the future events (beyond latest seq
number), they would subsribe to AEN (asynchronous event notification) and
wait for the events to happen.
