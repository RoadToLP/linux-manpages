.SH NAME
lpfc_irq_rebalance \- rebalances IRQ affinity according to cpuhp event
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" lpfc_irq_rebalance
.BI "(struct lpfc_hba *phba "  ","
.BI "unsigned int cpu "  ","
.BI "bool offline "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "phba" 12
pointer to HBA context object.
.IP "cpu" 12
cpu going offline/online
.IP "offline" 12
true, cpu is going offline. false, cpu is coming online.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
If cpu is going offline, we'll try our best effort to find the next
online cpu on the phba's original_mask and migrate all offlining IRQ
affinities.

If cpu is coming online, reaffinitize the IRQ back to the onlining cpu.
.SH "NOTE"
Call only if NUMA or NHT mode is enabled, otherwise rely on
PCI_IRQ_AFFINITY to auto-manage IRQ affinity.
