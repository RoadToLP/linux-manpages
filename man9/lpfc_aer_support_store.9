.BI "const char *buf "  ","
.BI "size_t count "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dev" 12
class device that is converted into a Scsi_host.
.IP "attr" 12
device attribute, not used.
.IP "buf" 12
containing enable or disable aer flag.
.IP "count" 12
unused variable.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
If the val is 1 and currently the device's AER capability was not
enabled, invoke the kernel's enable AER helper routine, trying to
enable the device's AER capability. If the helper routine enabling
AER returns success, update the device's cfg_aer_support flag to
indicate AER is supported by the device; otherwise, if the device
AER capability is already enabled to support AER, then do nothing.

If the val is 0 and currently the device's AER support was enabled,
invoke the kernel's disable AER helper routine. After that, update
the device's cfg_aer_support flag to indicate AER is not supported
by the device; otherwise, if the device AER capability is already
disabled from supporting AER, then do nothing.
.SH "RETURN"
length of the buf on success if val is in range the intended mode
is supported.
-EINVAL if val out of range or intended mode is not supported.
