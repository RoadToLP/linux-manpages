.SH "DESCRIPTION"

This clears the CPU from mm_cpumask for all processes, and then flushes the
local TLB to ensure TLB coherency in case the CPU is onlined again.

KVM guest translations are not necessarily flushed here. If KVM started
using mm_cpumask or the Linux APIs which do, this would have to be resolved.
