.SH NAME
pipapo_drop \- Delete entry from lookup and mapping tables, given rule map
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" pipapo_drop
.BI "(struct nft_pipapo_match *m "  ","
.BI "union nft_pipapo_map_bucket rulemap[] "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "m" 12
Matching data
.IP "rulemap" 12
Table of rule maps, arrays of first rule and amount of rules
in next field a given entry maps to, for each field
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
For each rule in lookup table buckets mapping to this set of rules, drop
all bits set in lookup table mapping. In pictures, assuming we want to drop
rules 0 and 1 from this lookup table:

bucket
group  0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9  10  11  12  13  14  15
0    0                                              1,2
1   1,2                                      0
2    0                                      1,2
3    0                              1,2
4  0,1,2
5    0   1   2
6  0,1,2 1   1   1   1   1   1   1   1   1   1   1   1   1   1   1
7   1,2 1,2  1   1   1  0,1  1   1   1   1   1   1   1   1   1   1

rule 2 becomes rule 0, and the result will be:

bucket
group  0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9  10  11  12  13  14  15
0                                                    0
1    0
2                                            0
3                                    0
4    0
5            0
6    0
7    0   0

once this is done, call \fBunmap\fP to drop all the corresponding rule references
from mapping tables.
