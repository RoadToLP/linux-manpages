.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Walk \fIcgrp\fP's subtree and create new csses or make the existing ones
visible.  A css is created invisible if it's being implicitly enabled
through dependency.  An invisible css is made visible when the userland
explicitly enables it.

Returns 0 on success, -errno on failure.  On failure, csses which have
been processed already aren't cleaned up.  The caller is responsible for
cleaning up with \fBcgroup_apply_control_disable\fP.
