.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "client" 12
SA client
.IP "device" 12
device to send request on
.IP "port_num" 12
port number to send request on
.IP "method" 12
SA method - should be get, set, or delete
.IP "rec" 12
Service Record to send in request
.IP "comp_mask" 12
component mask to send in request
.IP "timeout_ms" 12
time to wait for response
.IP "gfp_mask" 12
GFP mask to use for internal allocations
.IP "callback" 12
function called when request completes, times out or is
canceled
.IP "context" 12
opaque user context passed to callback
.IP "sa_query" 12
request context, used to cancel request
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Send a Service Record set/get/delete to the SA to register,
unregister or query a service record.
The callback function will be called when the request completes (or
fails); status is 0 for a successful response, -EINTR if the query
is canceled, -ETIMEDOUT is the query timed out, or -EIO if an error
occurred sending the query.  The resp parameter of the callback is
only valid if status is 0.

If the return value of \fBib_sa_service_rec_query\fP is negative, it is an
error code.  Otherwise it is a request ID that can be used to cancel
the query.
