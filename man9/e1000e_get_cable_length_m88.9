.SH NAME
e1000e_get_cable_length_m88 \- Determine cable length for m88 PHY
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "s32" e1000e_get_cable_length_m88
.BI "(struct e1000_hw *hw "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "hw" 12
pointer to the HW structure

Reads the PHY specific status register to retrieve the cable length
information.  The cable length is determined by averaging the minimum and
maximum values to get the "average" cable length.  The m88 PHY has four
possible cable length values, which are:
Register Value          Cable Length
0                       < 50 meters
1                       50 - 80 meters
2                       80 - 110 meters
3                       110 - 140 meters
4                       > 140 meters
