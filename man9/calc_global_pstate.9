.SH NAME
calc_global_pstate \- Calculate global pstate
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" calc_global_pstate
.BI "(unsigned int elapsed_time "  ","
.BI "int highest_lpstate_idx "  ","
.BI "int local_pstate_idx "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "elapsed_time" 12
Elapsed time in milliseconds
.IP "highest_lpstate_idx" 12
pstate from which its ramping down
.IP "local_pstate_idx" 12
New local pstate
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Finds the appropriate global pstate based on the pstate from which its
ramping down and the time elapsed in ramping down. It follows a quadratic
equation which ensures that it reaches ramping down to pmin in 5sec.
