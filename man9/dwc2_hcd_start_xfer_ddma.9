.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "hsotg" 12
The HCD state structure for the DWC OTG controller
.IP "qh" 12

.SH "RETURN"
0 if successful, negative error code otherwise
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
For Control and Bulk endpoints, initializes descriptor list and starts the
transfer. For Interrupt and Isochronous endpoints, initializes descriptor
list then updates FrameList, marking appropriate entries as active.

For Isochronous endpoints the starting descriptor index is calculated based
on the scheduled frame, but only on the first transfer descriptor within a
session. Then the transfer is started via enabling the channel.

For Isochronous endpoints the channel is not halted on XferComplete
interrupt so remains assigned to the endpoint(QH) until session is done.
