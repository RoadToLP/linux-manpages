.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Force the MAC's flow control settings.  Sets the TFCE and RFCE bits in the
device control register to reflect the adapter settings.  TFCE and RFCE
need to be explicitly set by software when a copper PHY is used because
autonegotiation is managed by the PHY rather than the MAC.  Software must
also configure these bits when link is forced on a fiber connection.
