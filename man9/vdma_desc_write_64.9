.SH NAME
vdma_desc_write_64 \- 64-bit descriptor write
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" vdma_desc_write_64
.BI "(struct xilinx_dma_chan *chan "  ","
.BI "u32 reg "  ","
.BI "u32 value_lsb "  ","
.BI "u32 value_msb "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "chan" 12
Driver specific VDMA channel
.IP "reg" 12
Register to write
.IP "value_lsb" 12
lower address of the descriptor.
.IP "value_msb" 12
upper address of the descriptor.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Since vdma driver is trying to write to a register offset which is not a
multiple of 64 bits(ex : 0x5c), we are writing as two separate 32 bits
instead of a single 64 bit register write.
