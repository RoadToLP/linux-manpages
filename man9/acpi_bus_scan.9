.SH NAME
acpi_bus_scan \- Add ACPI device node objects in a given namespace scope.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" acpi_bus_scan
.BI "(acpi_handle handle "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "handle" 12
Root of the namespace scope to scan.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Scan a given ACPI tree (probably recently hot-plugged) and create and add
found devices.

If no devices were found, -ENODEV is returned, but it does not mean that
there has been a real error.  There just have been no suitable ACPI objects
in the table trunk from which the kernel could create a device and add an
appropriate driver.

Must be called under acpi_scan_lock.
