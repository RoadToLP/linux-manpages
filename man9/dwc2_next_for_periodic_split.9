.SH NAME
dwc2_next_for_periodic_split \- Set next_active_frame midway thru a split.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" dwc2_next_for_periodic_split
.BI "(struct dwc2_hsotg *hsotg "  ","
.BI "struct dwc2_qh *qh "  ","
.BI "u16 frame_number "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "hsotg" 12
The HCD state structure
.IP "qh" 12
QH for the periodic transfer.
.IP "frame_number" 12
The current frame number.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

This is called for setting next_active_frame for periodic splits for all but
the first packet of the split.  Confusing?  I thought so...

Periodic splits are single low/full speed transfers that we end up splitting
up into several high speed transfers.  They always fit into one full (1 ms)
frame but might be split over several microframes (125 us each).  We to put
each of the parts on a very specific high speed frame.

This function figures out where the next active uFrame needs to be.
.SH "RETURN"
number missed by (or 0 if we didn't miss).
