.SH "DESCRIPTION"
If this function is called once and -EINVAL is returned it may
indicate that the partner info needs to be refreshed for the
target unit address at which point the caller must invoke
\fBhvcs_get_partner_info\fP and then call this function again.  If,
for a second time, -EINVAL is returned then it indicates that
there is probably already a partner connection registered to a
different vty-server adapter.  It is also possible that a second
-EINVAL may indicate that one of the parms is not valid, for
instance if the link was removed between the vty-server adapter
and the vty adapter that you are trying to open.  Don't shoot the
messenger.  Firmware implemented it this way.
