.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" cap_convert_nscap

.BI "size_t size "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "mnt_userns" 12
user namespace of the mount the inode was found from
.IP "dentry" 12
used to retrieve inode to check permissions on
.IP "ivalue" 12
vfs caps value which may be modified by this function
.IP "size" 12
size of \fIivalue\fP
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
User requested a write of security.capability.  If needed, update the
xattr to change from v2 to v3, or to fixup the v3 rootid.

If the inode has been found through an idmapped mount the user namespace of
the vfsmount must be passed through \fImnt_userns\fP. This function will then
take care to map the inode according to \fImnt_userns\fP before checking
permissions. On non-idmapped mounts or if permission checking is to be
performed on the raw inode simply passs init_user_ns.

If all is ok, we return the new size, on error return < 0.
