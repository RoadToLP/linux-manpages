.SH NAME
debugfs_file_get \- mark the beginning of file data access
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" debugfs_file_get
.BI "(struct dentry *dentry "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dentry" 12
the dentry object whose data is being accessed.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Up to a matching call to \fBdebugfs_file_put\fP, any successive call
into the file removing functions \fBdebugfs_remove\fP and
\fBdebugfs_remove_recursive\fP will block. Since associated private
file data may only get freed after a successful return of any of
the removal functions, you may safely access it after a successful
call to \fBdebugfs_file_get\fP without worrying about lifetime issues.

If -EIO is returned, the file has already been removed and thus,
it is not safe to access any of its data. If, on the other hand,
it is allowed to access the file data, zero is returned.
