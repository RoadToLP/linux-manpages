.SH NAME
_base_check_pcie_native_sgl \- This function is called for PCIe end devices to determine if the driver needs to build a native SGL. If so, that native SGL is built in the special contiguous buffers allocated especially for PCIe SGL creation. If the driver will not build a native SGL, return TRUE and a normal IEEE SGL will be built. Currently this routine supports NVMe.
