.SH "DESCRIPTION"

clks are often initialized very early during boot before memory can be
dynamically allocated and well before debugfs is setup. This function
populates the debugfs clk directory once at boot-time when we know that
debugfs is setup. It should only be called once at boot-time, all other clks
added dynamically will be done so with clk_debug_register.
