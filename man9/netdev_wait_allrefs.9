.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This is called when unregistering network devices.

Any protocol or device that holds a reference should register
for netdevice notification, and cleanup and put back the
reference if they receive an UNREGISTER event.
We can get stuck here if buggy protocols don't correctly
call dev_put.
