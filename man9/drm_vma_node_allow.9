.SH NAME
drm_vma_node_allow \- Add open-file to list of allowed users
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" drm_vma_node_allow
.BI "(struct drm_vma_offset_node *node "  ","
.BI "struct drm_file *tag "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "node" 12
Node to modify
.IP "tag" 12
Tag of file to remove
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Add \fItag\fP to the list of allowed open-files for this node. If \fItag\fP is
already on this list, the ref-count is incremented.

The list of allowed-users is preserved across \fBdrm_vma_offset_add\fP and
\fBdrm_vma_offset_remove\fP calls. You may even call it if the node is currently
not added to any offset-manager.

You must remove all open-files the same number of times as you added them
before destroying the node. Otherwise, you will leak memory.

This is locked against concurrent access internally.
.SH "RETURN"
0 on success, negative error code on internal failure (out-of-mem)
