.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Just for debugging.  Drivers might want an option to dump state
to dmesg in case of error irq's.  (Hint, you probably want to
ratelimit this!)

The caller must wrap this \fBdrm_modeset_lock_all_ctx\fP and
\fBdrm_modeset_drop_locks\fP. If this is called from error irq handler, it should
not be enabled by default - if you are debugging errors you might
not care that this is racey, but calling this without all modeset locks held
is inherently unsafe.
