.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This helper undoes \fBcgroup_kn_lock_live\fP and should be invoked before
the method finishes if locking succeeded.  Note that once this function
returns the cgroup returned by \fBcgroup_kn_lock_live\fP may become
inaccessible any time.  If the caller intends to continue to access the
cgroup, it should pin it before invoking this function.
