.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Sending a signal is working as following:

if (cdev->async_queue)
kill_fasync(\fIcdev->async_queue\fP, SIGIO, POLL_IN);

Some devices also implement asynchronous notification to indicate
when the device can be written; in this case, of course,
kill_fasync must be called with a mode of POLL_OUT.
