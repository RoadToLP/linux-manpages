.SH NAME
drm_fb_helper_hotplug_event \- respond to a hotplug notification by probing all the outputs attached to the fb
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" drm_fb_helper_hotplug_event
.BI "(struct drm_fb_helper *fb_helper "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "fb_helper" 12
driver-allocated fbdev helper, can be NULL
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Scan the connectors attached to the fb_helper and try to put together a
setup after notification of a change in output configuration.

Called at runtime, takes the mode config locks to be able to check/change the
modeset configuration. Must be run from process context (which usually means
either the output polling work or a work item launched from the driver's
hotplug interrupt).

Note that drivers may call this even before calling
drm_fb_helper_initial_config but only after drm_fb_helper_init. This allows
for a race-free fbcon setup and will make sure that the fbdev emulation will
not miss any hotplug events.
.SH "RETURN"
0 on success and a non-zero error code otherwise.
