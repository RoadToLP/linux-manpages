.SH NAME
rhashtable_walk_start_check \- Start a hash table walk
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" rhashtable_walk_start_check
.BI "(struct rhashtable_iter *iter "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "iter" 12
Hash table iterator
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Start a hash table walk at the current iterator position.  Note that we take
the RCU lock in all cases including when we return an error.  So you must
always call rhashtable_walk_stop to clean up.

Returns zero if successful.

Returns -EAGAIN if resize event occured.  Note that the iterator
will rewind back to the beginning and you may use it immediately
by calling rhashtable_walk_next.

rhashtable_walk_start is defined as an inline variant that returns
void. This is preferred in cases where the caller would ignore
resize events and always continue.
