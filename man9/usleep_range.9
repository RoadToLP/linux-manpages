.SH NAME
usleep_range \- Sleep for an approximate time
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" usleep_range
.BI "(unsigned long min "  ","
.BI "unsigned long max "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "min" 12
Minimum time in usecs to sleep
.IP "max" 12
Maximum time in usecs to sleep
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
In non-atomic context where the exact wakeup time is flexible, use
\fBusleep_range\fP instead of \fBudelay\fP.  The sleep improves responsiveness
by avoiding the CPU-hogging busy-wait of \fBudelay\fP, and the range reduces
power usage by allowing hrtimers to take advantage of an already-
scheduled interrupt instead of scheduling a new one just for this sleep.
