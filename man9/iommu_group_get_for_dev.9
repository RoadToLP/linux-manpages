This function is intended to be called by IOMMU drivers and extended to
support common, bus-defined algorithms when determining or creating the
IOMMU group for a device.  On success, the caller will hold a reference
to the returned IOMMU group, which will already include the provided
device.  The reference should be released with \fBiommu_group_put\fP.
