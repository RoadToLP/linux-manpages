.SH "DESCRIPTION"
In order to be able to have time accounting of the various power states
(as used by programs such as PowerTOP to show the effectiveness of runtime
PM), we need to track the time spent in each state.
update_pm_runtime_accounting must be called each time before the
runtime_status field is updated, to account the time in the old state
correctly.
