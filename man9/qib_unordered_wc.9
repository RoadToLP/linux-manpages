.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Because our performance depends on our ability to do write combining mmio
writes in the most efficient way, we need to know if we are on an Intel
or AMD x86_64 processor.  AMD x86_64 processors flush WC buffers out in
the order completed, and so no special flushing is required to get
correct ordering.  Intel processors, however, will flush write buffers
out in "random" orders, and so explicit ordering is needed at times.
