.SH NAME
ssam_controller_shutdown \- Shut down the controller.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" ssam_controller_shutdown
.BI "(struct ssam_controller *ctrl "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "ctrl" 12
The controller.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Shuts down the controller by flushing all pending requests and stopping the
transmitter and receiver threads. All requests submitted after this call
will fail with -ESHUTDOWN. While it is discouraged to do so, this function
is safe to use in parallel with ongoing request submission.

In the course of this shutdown procedure, all currently registered
notifiers will be unregistered. It is, however, strongly recommended to not
rely on this behavior, and instead the party registering the notifier
should unregister it before the controller gets shut down, e.g. via the
SSAM bus which guarantees client devices to be removed before a shutdown.

Note that events may still be pending after this call, but, due to the
notifiers being unregistered, these events will be dropped when the
controller is subsequently destroyed via \fBssam_controller_destroy\fP.

This function must be called with the main controller lock held (i.e. by
calling \fBssam_controller_lock\fP).
