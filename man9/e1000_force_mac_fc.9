.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "hw" 12
Struct containing variables accessed by shared code
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Forces the MAC's flow control settings.
Sets the TFCE and RFCE bits in the device control register to reflect
the adapter settings. TFCE and RFCE need to be explicitly set by
software when a Copper PHY is used because autonegotiation is managed
by the PHY rather than the MAC. Software must also configure these
bits when link is forced on a fiber connection.
