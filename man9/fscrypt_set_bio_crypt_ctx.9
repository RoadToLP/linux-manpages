.SH NAME
fscrypt_set_bio_crypt_ctx \- prepare a file contents bio for inline crypto
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" fscrypt_set_bio_crypt_ctx
.BI "(struct bio *bio "  ","
.BI "const struct inode *inode "  ","
.BI "u64 first_lblk "  ","
.BI "gfp_t gfp_mask "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "bio" 12
a bio which will eventually be submitted to the file
.IP "inode" 12
the file's inode
.IP "first_lblk" 12
the first file logical block number in the I/O
.IP "gfp_mask" 12
memory allocation flags - these must be a waiting mask so that
bio_crypt_set_ctx can't fail.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
If the contents of the file should be encrypted (or decrypted) with inline
encryption, then assign the appropriate encryption context to the bio.

Normally the bio should be newly allocated (i.e. no pages added yet), as
otherwise \fBfscrypt_mergeable_bio\fP won't work as intended.

The encryption context will be freed automatically when the bio is freed.
