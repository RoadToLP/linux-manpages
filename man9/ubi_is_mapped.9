.SH NAME
ubi_is_mapped \- check if logical eraseblock is mapped.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" ubi_is_mapped
.BI "(struct ubi_volume_desc *desc "  ","
.BI "int lnum "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "desc" 12
volume descriptor
.IP "lnum" 12
logical eraseblock number
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function checks if logical eraseblock \fIlnum\fP is mapped to a physical
eraseblock. If a logical eraseblock is un-mapped, this does not necessarily
mean it will still be un-mapped after the UBI device is re-attached. The
logical eraseblock may become mapped to the physical eraseblock it was last
mapped to.

This function returns 1 if the LEB is mapped, 0 if not, and a negative
error code in case of failure. If the volume is damaged because of an
interrupted update this function just returns immediately with -EBADF error
code.
