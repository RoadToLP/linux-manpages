The framebuffer device.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Note that the offsets can be written to the device at any time, as their
values are latched at each vsync automatically. This also means that only
the last call to this function will have any effect on next vsync, but
there is no need to sleep waiting for it to prevent tearing.
