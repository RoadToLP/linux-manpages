parallel port to announce

After a port driver has registered a parallel port with
parport_register_port, and performed any necessary
initialisation or adjustments, it should call
\fBparport_announce_port\fP in order to notify all device drivers
that have called \fBparport_register_driver\fP.  Their \fBattach\fP
functions will be called, with \fIport\fP as the parameter.
