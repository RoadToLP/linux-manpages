.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "struct dma_buf *" dma_buf_export
.BI "(const struct dma_buf_export_info *exp_info "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "exp_info" 12
[in]    holds all the export related information provided
by the exporter. see \fIstruct dma_buf_export_info\fP
for further details.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Returns, on success, a newly created struct dma_buf object, which wraps the
supplied private data and operations for struct dma_buf_ops. On either
missing ops, or error in allocating struct dma_buf, will return negative
error.

For most cases the easiest way to create \fIexp_info\fP is through the
DEFINE_DMA_BUF_EXPORT_INFO macro.
