the global GGTT from which to reserve
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function is called at the initialization stage, to balloon out the
graphic address space allocated to other vGPUs, by marking these spaces as
reserved. The ballooning related knowledge(starting address and size of
the mappable/unmappable graphic memory) is described in the vgt_if structure
in a reserved mmio range.

To give an example, the drawing below depicts one typical scenario after
ballooning. Here the vGPU1 has 2 pieces of graphic address spaces ballooned
out each for the mappable and the non-mappable part. From the vGPU1 point of
view, the total size is the same as the physical one, with the start address
of its graphic space being zero. Yet there are some portions ballooned out(
the shadow part, which are marked as reserved by drm allocator). From the
host point of view, the graphic address space is partitioned by multiple
vGPUs in different VMs. ::
