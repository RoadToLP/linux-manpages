.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fIscsw\fP contains the I/O results of the channel program that pointed
to by \fIcp\fP. However what \fIscsw->cpa\fP stores is a host physical
address, which is meaningless for the guest, which is waiting for
the I/O results.

This function updates \fIscsw->cpa\fP to its coressponding guest physical
address.
