.SH NAME
__thermal_cooling_device_register \- register a new thermal cooling device
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "struct thermal_cooling_device *" __thermal_cooling_device_register
.BI "(struct device_node *np "  ","
.BI "const char *type "  ","
.BI "void *devdata "  ","
.BI "const struct thermal_cooling_device_ops *ops "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "np" 12
a pointer to a device tree node.
.IP "type" 12
the thermal cooling device type.
.IP "devdata" 12
device private data.
.IP "ops" 12
standard thermal cooling devices callbacks.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This interface function adds a new thermal cooling device (fan/processor/...)
to /sys/class/thermal/ folder as cooling_device[0-*]. It tries to bind itself
to all the thermal zone devices registered at the same time.
It also gives the opportunity to link the cooling device to a device tree
node, so that it can be bound to a thermal zone created out of device tree.
.SH "RETURN"
a pointer to the created struct thermal_cooling_device or an
ERR_PTR. Caller must check return value with IS_ERR*() helpers.
