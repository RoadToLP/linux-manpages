.SH NAME
caam_read_rsa_crt \- Used for reading dP, dQ, qInv CRT members. dP, dQ and qInv could decode to less than corresponding p, q length, as the BER-encoding requires that the minimum number of bytes be used to encode the integer. dP, dQ, qInv decoded values have to be zero-padded to appropriate length.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "u8 *" caam_read_rsa_crt
.BI "(const u8 *ptr "  ","
.BI "size_t nbytes "  ","
.BI "size_t dstlen "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "ptr" 12
pointer to {dP, dQ, qInv} CRT member
.IP "nbytes" 12
length in bytes of {dP, dQ, qInv} CRT member
.IP "dstlen" 12
length in bytes of corresponding p or q prime factor
