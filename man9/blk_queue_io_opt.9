.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" blk_queue_io_opt
.BI "(struct request_queue *q "  ","
.BI "unsigned int opt "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "q" 12
the request queue for the device
.IP "opt" 12
optimal request size in bytes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Storage devices may report an optimal I/O size, which is the
device's preferred unit for sustained I/O.  This is rarely reported
for disk drives.  For RAID arrays it is usually the stripe width or
the internal track size.  A properly aligned multiple of
optimal_io_size is the preferred request size for workloads where
sustained throughput is desired.
