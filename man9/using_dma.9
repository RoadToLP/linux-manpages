.SH NAME
using_dma \- return the DMA status of the driver.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "bool" using_dma
.BI "(struct dwc2_hsotg *hsotg "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "hsotg" 12
The driver state.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Return true if we're using DMA.

Currently, we have the DMA support code worked into everywhere
that needs it, but the AMBA DMA implementation in the hardware can
only DMA from 32bit aligned addresses. This means that gadgets such
as the CDC Ethernet cannot work as they often pass packets which are
not 32bit aligned.

Unfortunately the choice to use DMA or not is global to the controller
and seems to be only settable when the controller is being put through
a core reset. This means we either need to fix the gadgets to take
account of DMA alignment, or add bounce buffers (yuerk).

g_using_dma is set depending on dts flag.
