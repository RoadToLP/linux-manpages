.SH NAME
spi_mem_adjust_op_size \- Adjust the data size of a SPI mem operation to match controller limitations
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" spi_mem_adjust_op_size
.BI "(struct spi_mem *mem "  ","
.BI "struct spi_mem_op *op "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "mem" 12
the SPI memory
.IP "op" 12
the operation to adjust
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Some controllers have FIFO limitations and must split a data transfer
operation into multiple ones, others require a specific alignment for
optimized accesses. This function allows SPI mem drivers to split a single
operation into multiple sub-operations when required.
.SH "RETURN"
a negative error code if the controller can't properly adjust \fIop\fP,
0 otherwise. Note that \fIop->data.nbytes\fP will be updated if \fIop\fP
can't be handled in a single step.
