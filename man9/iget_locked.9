.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Search for the inode specified by \fIino\fP in the inode cache and if present
return it with an increased reference count. This is for file systems
where the inode number is sufficient for unique identification of an inode.

If the inode is not in cache, allocate a new inode and return it locked,
hashed, and with the I_NEW flag set.  The file system gets to fill it in
before unlocking it via \fBunlock_new_inode\fP.
