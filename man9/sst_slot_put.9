.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH ARGUMENTS

User data
(de)interleaver controls are defined in opposite sense to be user-friendly
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Instead of the enum value being the value written to the register, it is the
register address; and the kcontrol number (register num) is the value written
to the register. This is so that there can be only one value for each
slot/channel since there is only one control for each slot/channel.

This means that whenever an enum is set, we need to clear the bit
for that kcontrol_no for all the interleaver OR deinterleaver registers
