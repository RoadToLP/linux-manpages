.SH NAME
cxgb4vf_change_mac \- Update match filter for a MAC address.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" cxgb4vf_change_mac
.BI "(struct port_info *pi "  ","
.BI "unsigned int viid "  ","
.BI "int *tcam_idx "  ","
.BI "const u8 *addr "  ","
.BI "bool persistent "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "pi" 12
the port_info
.IP "viid" 12
the VI id
.IP "tcam_idx" 12
TCAM index of existing filter for old value of MAC address,
or -1
.IP "addr" 12
the new MAC address value
.IP "persistent" 12
whether a new MAC allocation should be persistent

Modifies an MPS filter and sets it to the new MAC address if
\fItcam_idx\fP >= 0, or adds the MAC address to a new filter if
\fItcam_idx\fP < 0. In the latter case the address is added persistently
if \fIpersist\fP is true.
Addresses are programmed to hash region, if tcam runs out of entries.
