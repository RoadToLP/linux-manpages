.SH NAME
device_links_check_suppliers \- Check presence of supplier drivers.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" device_links_check_suppliers
.BI "(struct device *dev "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dev" 12
Consumer device.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Check links from this device to any suppliers.  Walk the list of the device's
links to suppliers and see if all of them are available.  If not, simply
return -EPROBE_DEFER.

We need to guarantee that the supplier will not go away after the check has
been positive here.  It only can go away in \fB__device_release_driver\fP and
that function  checks the device's links to consumers.  This means we need to
mark the link as "consumer probe in progress" to make the supplier removal
wait for us to complete (or bad things may happen).

Links without the DL_FLAG_MANAGED flag set are ignored.
