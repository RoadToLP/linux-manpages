.SH NAME
cpuidle_coupled_clear_pokes \- spin until the poke interrupt is processed
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" cpuidle_coupled_clear_pokes
.BI "(int cpu "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "cpu" 12
this cpu
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Turns on interrupts and spins until any outstanding poke interrupts have
been processed and the poke bit has been cleared.

Other interrupts may also be processed while interrupts are enabled, so
\fBneed_resched\fP must be tested after this function returns to make sure
the interrupt didn't schedule work that should take the cpu out of idle.

Returns 0 if no poke was pending, 1 if a poke was cleared.
