frame buffer info structure

Unregisters a frame buffer device \fIfb_info\fP.

Returns negative errno on error, or zero for success.

This function will also notify the framebuffer console
to release the driver.

This is meant to be called within a driver's \fBmodule_exit\fP
function. If this is called outside \fBmodule_exit\fP, ensure
that the driver implements \fBfb_open\fP and \fBfb_release\fP to
check that no processes are using the device.
