This is called at the end of the section where spinning is allowed.
It has two functions. First, it is a signal that it is no longer
safe to start busy waiting for the lock. Second, it checks if
there is a busy waiter and passes the lock rights to her.

Important: Callers lose the lock if there was a busy waiter.
They must not touch items synchronized by console_lock
in this case.
