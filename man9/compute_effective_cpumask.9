.SH NAME
compute_effective_cpumask \- Compute the effective cpumask of the cpuset
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" compute_effective_cpumask
.BI "(struct cpumask *new_cpus "  ","
.BI "struct cpuset *cs "  ","
.BI "struct cpuset *parent "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "new_cpus" 12
the temp variable for the new effective_cpus mask
.IP "cs" 12
the cpuset the need to recompute the new effective_cpus mask
.IP "parent" 12
the parent cpuset
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
If the parent has subpartition CPUs, include them in the list of
allowable CPUs in computing the new effective_cpus mask. Since offlined
CPUs are not removed from subparts_cpus, we have to use cpu_active_mask
to mask those out.
