omap3_noncore_dpll_enable \- instruct a DPLL to enter bypass or lock mode
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" omap3_noncore_dpll_enable
.BI "(struct clk_hw *hw "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "hw" 12
struct clk_hw containing then pointer to a DPLL struct clk
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Instructs a non-CORE DPLL to enable, e.g., to enter bypass or lock.
The choice of modes depends on the DPLL's programmed rate: if it is
the same as the DPLL's parent clock, it will enter bypass;
otherwise, it will enter lock.  This code will wait for the DPLL to
indicate readiness before returning, unless the DPLL takes too long
to enter the target state.  Intended to be used as the struct clk's
enable function.  If DPLL3 was passed in, or the DPLL does not
support low-power stop, or if the DPLL took too long to enter
bypass or lock, return -EINVAL; otherwise, return 0.
