.SH NAME
get_addr_ref_16 \- Obtain the 16-bit address referred by instruction
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void __user *" get_addr_ref_16
.BI "(struct insn *insn "  ","
.BI "struct pt_regs *regs "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "insn" 12
Instruction containing ModRM byte and displacement
.IP "regs" 12
Register values as seen when entering kernel mode
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function is to be used with 16-bit address encodings. Obtain the memory
address referred by the instruction's ModRM and displacement bytes. Also, the
segment used as base is determined by either any segment override prefixes in
\fIinsn\fP or the default segment of the registers involved in the address
computation. In protected mode, segment limits are enforced.

Linear address referenced by the instruction operands on success.

-1L on error.
