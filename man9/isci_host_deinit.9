.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This is called in either the driver shutdown or the suspend path.  In
the shutdown case libsas went through port teardown and normal device
removal (i.e. physical links stayed up to service scsi_device removal
commands).  In the suspend case we disable the hardware without
notifying libsas of the link down events since we want libsas to
remember the domain across the suspend/resume cycle
