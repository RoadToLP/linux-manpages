.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function walks through the entire mode setting configuration of \fIdev\fP. It
will remove any CRTC links of unused encoders and encoder links of
disconnected connectors. Then it will disable all unused encoders and CRTCs
either by calling their disable callback if available or by calling their
dpms callback with DRM_MODE_DPMS_OFF.

This function is part of the legacy modeset helper library and will cause
major confusion with atomic drivers. This is because atomic helpers guarantee
to never call ->\fBdisable\fP hooks on a disabled function, or ->\fBenable\fP hooks
on an enabled functions. \fBdrm_helper_disable_unused_functions\fP on the other
hand throws such guarantees into the wind and calls disable hooks
unconditionally on unused functions.
