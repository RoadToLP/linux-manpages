.SH NAME
kvm_vcpu_put_sysregs_vhe \- Restore host system registers to the physical CPU
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" kvm_vcpu_put_sysregs_vhe
.BI "(struct kvm_vcpu *vcpu "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "vcpu" 12
The VCPU pointer
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Save guest system registers that do not affect the host's execution, for
example EL1 system registers on a VHE system where the host kernel
runs at EL2.  This function is called from KVM's \fBvcpu_put\fP function
and deferring saving system register state until we're no longer running the
VCPU avoids having to save them on every exit from the VM.
