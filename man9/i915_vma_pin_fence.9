.BI "(struct i915_vma *vma "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "vma" 12
vma to map through a fence reg
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
When mapping objects through the GTT, userspace wants to be able to write
to them without having to worry about swizzling if the object is tiled.
This function walks the fence regs looking for a free one for \fIobj\fP,
stealing one if it can't find any.

It then sets up the reg based on the object's properties: address, pitch
and tiling format.

For an untiled surface, this removes any existing fence.

0 on success, negative error code on failure.
.SH "RETURN"
