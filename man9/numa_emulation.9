numa_emulation \- Emulate NUMA nodes
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" numa_emulation
.BI "(struct numa_meminfo *numa_meminfo "  ","
.BI "int numa_dist_cnt "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "numa_meminfo" 12
NUMA configuration to massage
.IP "numa_dist_cnt" 12
The size of the physical NUMA distance table
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Emulate NUMA nodes according to the numa=fake kernel parameter.
\fInuma_meminfo\fP contains the physical memory configuration and is modified
to reflect the emulated configuration on success.  \fInuma_dist_cnt\fP is
used to determine the size of the physical distance table.

On success, the following modifications are made.

- \fInuma_meminfo\fP is updated to reflect the emulated nodes.

- __apicid_to_node[] is updated such that APIC IDs are mapped to the
emulated nodes.

- NUMA distance table is rebuilt to represent distances between emulated
nodes.  The distances are determined considering how emulated nodes
are mapped to physical nodes and match the actual distances.

- emu_nid_to_phys[] reflects how emulated nodes are mapped to physical
nodes.  This is used by \fBnuma_add_cpu\fP and \fBnuma_remove_cpu\fP.

If emulation is not enabled or fails, emu_nid_to_phys[] is filled with
identity mapping and no other modification is made.
