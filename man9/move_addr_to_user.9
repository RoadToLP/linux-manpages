.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" move_addr_to_user
.BI "(struct sockaddr_storage *kaddr "  ","
.BI "int klen "  ","
.BI "void __user *uaddr "  ","
.BI "int __user *ulen "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "kaddr" 12
kernel space address
.IP "klen" 12
length of address in kernel
.IP "uaddr" 12
user space address
.IP "ulen" 12
pointer to user length field

The value pointed to by ulen on entry is the buffer length available.
This is overwritten with the buffer space used. -EINVAL is returned
if an overlong buffer is specified or a negative buffer size. -EFAULT
is returned if either the buffer or the length field are not
accessible.
After copying the data up to the limit the user specifies, the true
length of the data is written over the length limit the user
specified. Zero is returned for a success.
