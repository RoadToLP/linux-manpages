.SH NAME
get_image_page \- Allocate a page for a hibernation image.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void *" get_image_page
.BI "(gfp_t gfp_mask "  ","
.BI "int safe_needed "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gfp_mask" 12
GFP mask for the allocation.
.IP "safe_needed" 12
Get pages that were not used before hibernation (restore only)
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
During image restoration, for storing the PBE list and the image data, we can
only use memory pages that do not conflict with the pages used before
hibernation.  The "unsafe" pages have PageNosaveFree set and we count them
using allocated_unsafe_pages.

Each allocated image page is marked as PageNosave and PageNosaveFree so that
\fBswsusp_free\fP can release it.
