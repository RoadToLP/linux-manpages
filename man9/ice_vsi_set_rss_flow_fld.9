.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function will only be called after successful download package call
during initialization of PF. Since the downloaded package will erase the
RSS section, this function will configure RSS input sets for different
flow types. The last profile added has the highest priority, therefore 2
tuple profiles (i.e. IPv4 src/dst) are added before 4 tuple profiles
(i.e. IPv4 src/dst TCP src/dst port).
