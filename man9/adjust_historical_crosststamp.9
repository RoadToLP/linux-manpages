.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "history" 12
Snapshot representing start of history
.IP "partial_history_cycles" 12
Cycle offset into history (fractional part)
.IP "total_history_cycles" 12
Total history length in cycles
.IP "discontinuity" 12
True indicates clock was set on history period
.IP "ts" 12
Cross timestamp that should be adjusted using
partial/total ratio
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Helper function used by \fBget_device_system_crosststamp\fP to correct the
crosstimestamp corresponding to the start of the current interval to the
system counter value (timestamp point) provided by the driver. The
total_history_* quantities are the total history starting at the provided
reference point and ending at the start of the current interval. The cycle
count between the driver timestamp point and the start of the current
interval is partial_history_cycles.
