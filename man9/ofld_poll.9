The NAPI handler for offload packets when a response queue is serviced
by the hard interrupt handler, i.e., when it's operating in non-polling
mode.  Creates small packet batches and sends them through the offload
receive handler.  Batches need to be of modest size as we do prefetches
on the packets in each.
