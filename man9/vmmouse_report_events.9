.SH NAME
vmmouse_report_events \- process events on the vmmouse communications channel
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "psmouse_ret_t" vmmouse_report_events
.BI "(struct psmouse *psmouse "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "psmouse" 12
Pointer to the psmouse struct
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function pulls events from the vmmouse communications channel and
reports them on the correct (absolute or relative) input device. When the
communications channel is drained, or if we've processed more than 255
psmouse commands, the function returns PSMOUSE_FULL_PACKET. If there is a
host- or synchronization error, the function returns PSMOUSE_BAD_DATA in
the hope that the caller will reset the communications channel.
