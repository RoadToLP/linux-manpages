.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "bool" fcoe_oem_match
.BI "(struct fc_frame *fp "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS

The I/O frame
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This routine will be associated with an exchange manager (EM). When
the libfc exchange handling code is looking for an EM to use it will
call this routine and pass it the frame that it wishes to send. This
routine will return True if the associated EM is to be used and False
if the echange code should continue looking for an EM.

The offload EM that this routine is associated with will handle any
packets that are for SCSI read requests.

This has been enhanced to work when FCoE stack is operating in target
mode.
.SH "RETURN"
True for read types I/O, otherwise returns false.
