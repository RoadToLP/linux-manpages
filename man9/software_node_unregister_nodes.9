.SH NAME
software_node_unregister_nodes \- Unregister an array of software nodes
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" software_node_unregister_nodes
.BI "(const struct software_node *nodes "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "nodes" 12
Zero terminated array of software nodes to be unregistered
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Unregister multiple software nodes at once. If parent pointers are set up
in any of the software nodes then the array **must** be ordered such that
parents come before their children.
.SH "NOTE"
If you are uncertain whether the array is ordered such that
parents will be unregistered before their children, it is wiser to
remove the nodes individually, in the correct order (child before
parent).
