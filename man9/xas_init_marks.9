Array operations state.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Initialise all marks for the entry specified by \fIxas\fP.  If we're tracking
free entries with a mark, we need to set it on all entries.  All other
marks are cleared.

This implementation is not as efficient as it could be; we may walk
up the tree multiple times.
