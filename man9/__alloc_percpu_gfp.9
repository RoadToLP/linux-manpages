.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void __percpu *" __alloc_percpu_gfp
.BI "(size_t size "  ","
.BI "size_t align "  ","
.BI "gfp_t gfp "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "size" 12
size of area to allocate in bytes
.IP "align" 12
alignment of area (max PAGE_SIZE)
.IP "gfp" 12
allocation flags
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Allocate zero-filled percpu area of \fIsize\fP bytes aligned at \fIalign\fP.  If
\fIgfp\fP doesn't contain GFP_KERNEL, the allocation doesn't block and can
be called from any context but is a lot more likely to fail. If \fIgfp\fP
has __GFP_NOWARN then no warning will be triggered on invalid or failed
allocation requests.
.SH "RETURN"
Percpu pointer to the allocated area on success, NULL on failure.
