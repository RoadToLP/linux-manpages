.SH NAME
seq_put_decimal_ull_width \- A helper routine for putting decimal numbers without rich format of printf(). only 'unsigned long long' is supported.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" seq_put_decimal_ull_width
.BI "(struct seq_file *m "  ","
.BI "const char *delimiter "  ","
.BI "unsigned long long num "  ","
.BI "unsigned int width "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "m" 12
seq_file identifying the buffer to which data should be written
.IP "delimiter" 12
a string which is printed before the number
.IP "num" 12
the number
.IP "width" 12
a minimum field width
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This routine will put strlen(delimiter) + number into seq_filed.
This routine is very quick when you show lots of numbers.
In usual cases, it will be better to use \fBseq_printf\fP. It's easier to read.
