.SH NAME
snapshot_read_next \- Get the address to read the next image page from.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" snapshot_read_next
.BI "(struct snapshot_handle *handle "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "handle" 12
Snapshot handle to be used for the reading.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
On the first call, \fIhandle\fP should point to a zeroed snapshot_handle
structure.  The structure gets populated then and a pointer to it should be
passed to this function every next time.

On success, the function returns a positive number.  Then, the caller
is allowed to read up to the returned number of bytes from the memory
location computed by the \fBdata_of\fP macro.

The function returns 0 to indicate the end of the data stream condition,
and negative numbers are returned on errors.  If that happens, the structure
pointed to by \fIhandle\fP is not updated and should not be used any more.
