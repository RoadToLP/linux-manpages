.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Read any pending MST interrupts, call MST core to handle these and ack the
interrupts. Check if the main and AUX link state is ok.

- true if pending interrupts were serviced (or no interrupts were
pending) w/o detecting an error condition.
- false if an error condition - like AUX failure or a loss of link - is
detected, which needs servicing from the hotplug work.
