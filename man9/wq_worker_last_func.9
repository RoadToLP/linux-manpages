.SH NAME
wq_worker_last_func \- retrieve worker's last work function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "work_func_t" wq_worker_last_func
.BI "(struct task_struct *task "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "task" 12
Task to retrieve last work function of.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Determine the last function a worker executed. This is called from
the scheduler to get a worker's last known identity.

This function is called during \fBschedule\fP when a kworker is going
to sleep. It's used by psi to identify aggregation workers during
dequeuing, to allow periodic aggregation to shut-off when that
worker is the last task in the system or cgroup to go to sleep.

As this function doesn't involve any workqueue-related locking, it
only returns stable values when called from inside the scheduler's
queuing and dequeuing paths, when \fItask\fP, which must be a kworker,
is guaranteed to not be processing any works.
.SH "CONTEXT"
raw_spin_lock_irq(rq->lock)
.SH "RETURN"
The last work function current executed as a worker, NULL if it
hasn't executed any work yet.
