.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function is called when a user tries to mmap with an offset (returned
by \fBrdma_user_mmap_get_offset\fP) it initially received from the driver. The
rdma_user_mmap_entry was created by the function
\fBrdma_user_mmap_entry_insert\fP.  This function increases the refcnt of the
entry so that it won't be deleted from the xarray in the meantime.

Return an reference to an entry if exists or NULL if there is no
match. \fBrdma_user_mmap_entry_put\fP must be called to put the reference.
