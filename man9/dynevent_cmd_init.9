.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "cmd" 12
A pointer to the dynevent_cmd struct representing the cmd
.IP "buf" 12
A pointer to the buffer to generate the command into
.IP "maxlen" 12
The length of the buffer the command will be generated into
.IP "type" 12
The type of the cmd, checked against further operations
.IP "run_command" 12
The type-specific function that will actually run the command
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Initialize a dynevent_cmd.  A dynevent_cmd is used to build up and
run dynamic event creation commands, such as commands for creating
synthetic and kprobe events.  Before calling any of the functions
used to build the command, a dynevent_cmd object should be
instantiated and initialized using this function.

The initialization sets things up by saving a pointer to the
user-supplied buffer and its length via the \fIbuf\fP and \fImaxlen\fP
params, and by saving the cmd-specific \fItype\fP and \fIrun_command\fP
params which are used to check subsequent dynevent_cmd operations
and actually run the command when complete.
