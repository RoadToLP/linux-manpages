.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBbio_endio\fP will end I/O on the whole bio. \fBbio_endio\fP is the preferred
way to end I/O on a bio. No one should call \fBbi_end_io\fP directly on a
bio unless they own it and thus know that it has an end_io function.

\fBbio_endio\fP can be called several times on a bio that has been chained
using \fBbio_chain\fP.  The ->\fBbi_end_io\fP function will only be called the
last time.  At this point the BLK_TA_COMPLETE tracing event will be
generated if BIO_TRACE_COMPLETION is set.
