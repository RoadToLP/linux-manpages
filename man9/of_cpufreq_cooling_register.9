.SH NAME
of_cpufreq_cooling_register \- function to create cpufreq cooling device.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "struct thermal_cooling_device *" of_cpufreq_cooling_register
.BI "(struct cpufreq_policy *policy "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "policy" 12
cpufreq policy
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This interface function registers the cpufreq cooling device with the name
"thermal-cpufreq-x". This api can support multiple instances of cpufreq
cooling devices. Using this API, the cpufreq cooling device will be
linked to the device tree node provided.

Using this function, the cooling device will implement the power
extensions by using a simple cpu power model.  The cpus must have
registered their OPPs using the OPP library.

It also takes into account, if property present in policy CPU node, the
static power consumed by the cpu.
.SH "RETURN"
a valid struct thermal_cooling_device pointer on success,
and NULL on failure.
