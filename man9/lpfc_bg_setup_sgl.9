.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "phba" 12
The Hba for which this call is being executed.
.IP "sc" 12
pointer to scsi command we're working on
.IP "sgl" 12
pointer to buffer list for protection groups
.IP "datasegcnt" 12
number of segments of data that have been dma mapped
.IP "lpfc_cmd" 12
lpfc scsi command object pointer.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function sets up SGL buffer list for protection groups of
type LPFC_PG_TYPE_NO_DIF

This is usually used when the HBA is instructed to generate
DIFs and insert them into data stream (or strip DIF from
incoming data stream)

The buffer list consists of just one protection group described
below:
+-------------------------+
start of prot group  -->     |         DI_SEED         |
+-------------------------+
|         Data SGE        |
+-------------------------+
|more Data SGE's ... (opt)|
+-------------------------+


Returns the number of SGEs added to the SGL.
.SH "NOTE"
Data s/g buffers have been dma mapped
