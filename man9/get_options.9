.SH NAME
get_options \- Parse a string into a list of integers
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "char *" get_options
.BI "(const char *str "  ","
.BI "int nints "  ","
.BI "int *ints "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "str" 12
String to be parsed
.IP "nints" 12
size of integer array
.IP "ints" 12
integer array (must have room for at least one element)

This function parses a string containing a comma-separated
list of integers, a hyphen-separated range of _positive_ integers,
or a combination of both.  The parse halts when the array is
full, or when no more numbers can be retrieved from the
string.

When \fInints\fP is 0, the function just validates the given \fIstr\fP and
returns the amount of parseable integers as described below.
.SH "RETURN"

The first element is filled by the number of collected integers
in the range. The rest is what was parsed from the \fIstr\fP.

Return value is the character in the string which caused
the parse to end (typically a null terminator, if \fIstr\fP is
completely parseable).
