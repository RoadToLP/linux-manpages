scsi device to quiesce.

This works by trying to transition to the SDEV_QUIESCE state
(which must be a legal transition).  When the device is in this
state, only power management requests will be accepted, all others will
be deferred.

Must be called with user context, may sleep.

Returns zero if unsuccessful or an error if not.
