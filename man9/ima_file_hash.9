.SH NAME
ima_file_hash \- return the stored measurement if a file has been hashed and is in the iint cache.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" ima_file_hash
.BI "(struct file *file "  ","
.BI "char *buf "  ","
.BI "size_t buf_size "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "file" 12
pointer to the file
.IP "buf" 12
buffer in which to store the hash
.IP "buf_size" 12
length of the buffer
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
On success, return the hash algorithm (as defined in the enum hash_algo).
If buf is not NULL, this function also outputs the hash into buf.
If the hash is larger than buf_size, then only buf_size bytes will be copied.
It generally just makes sense to pass a buffer capable of holding the largest
possible hash: IMA_MAX_DIGEST_SIZE.
The file hash returned is based on the entire file, including the appended
signature.

If IMA is disabled or if no measurement is available, return -EOPNOTSUPP.
If the parameters are incorrect, return -EINVAL.
