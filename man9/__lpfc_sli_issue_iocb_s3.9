.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "phba" 12
Pointer to HBA context object.
.IP "ring_number" 12
SLI ring number to issue iocb on.
.IP "piocb" 12
Pointer to command iocb.
.IP "flag" 12
Flag indicating if this command can be put into txq.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
__lpfc_sli_issue_iocb_s3 is used by other functions in the driver to issue
an iocb command to an HBA with SLI-3 interface spec. If the PCI slot is
recovering from error state, if HBA is resetting or if LPFC_STOP_IOCB_EVENT
flag is turned on, the function returns IOCB_ERROR. When the link is down,
this function allows only iocbs for posting buffers. This function finds
next available slot in the command ring and posts the command to the
available slot and writes the port attention register to request HBA start
processing new iocb. If there is no slot available in the ring and
flag & SLI_IOCB_RET_IOCB is set, the new iocb is added to the txq, otherwise
the function returns IOCB_BUSY.

This function is called with hbalock held. The function will return success
after it successfully submit the iocb to firmware or after adding to the
txq.
