.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Enable microphone detection via IRQ on the WM8962.  If GPIOs are
being used to bring out signals to the processor then only platform
data configuration is needed for WM8962 and processor GPIOs should
be configured using \fBsnd_soc_jack_add_gpios\fP instead.

If no jack is supplied detection will be disabled.
