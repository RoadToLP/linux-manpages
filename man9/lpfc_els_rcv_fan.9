.SH NAME
lpfc_els_rcv_fan \- Process an unsolicited fan iocb command
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" lpfc_els_rcv_fan
.BI "(struct lpfc_vport *vport "  ","
.BI "struct lpfc_iocbq *cmdiocb "  ","
.BI "struct lpfc_nodelist *fan_ndlp "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "vport" 12
pointer to a host virtual N_Port data structure.
.IP "cmdiocb" 12
pointer to lpfc command iocb data structure.
.IP "fan_ndlp" 12
pointer to a node-list data structure.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This routine processes a Fabric Address Notification (FAN) IOCB
command received as an ELS unsolicited event. The FAN ELS command will
only be processed on a physical port (i.e., the \fIvport\fP represents the
physical port). The fabric NodeName and PortName from the FAN IOCB are
compared against those in the phba data structure. If any of those is
different, the \fBlpfc_initial_flogi\fP routine is invoked to initialize
Fabric Login (FLOGI) to the fabric to start the discover over. Otherwise,
if both of those are identical, the \fBlpfc_issue_fabric_reglogin\fP routine
is invoked to register login to the fabric.

Return code
0 - Successfully processed fan iocb (currently always return 0).
