.SH NAME
__wrpll_calc_divq \- determine DIVQ based on target PLL output clock rate
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "u8" __wrpll_calc_divq
.BI "(u32 target_rate "  ","
.BI "u64 *vco_rate "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "target_rate" 12
target PLL output clock rate
.IP "vco_rate" 12
pointer to a u64 to store the computed VCO rate into
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Determine a reasonable value for the PLL Q post-divider, based on the
target output rate \fItarget_rate\fP for the PLL.  Along with returning the
computed Q divider value as the return value, this function stores the
desired target VCO rate into the variable pointed to by \fIvco_rate\fP.
.SH "CONTEXT"
Any context.  Caller must protect the memory pointed to by
\fIvco_rate\fP from simultaneous access or modification.
.SH "RETURN"
a positive integer DIVQ value to be programmed into the hardware
upon success, or 0 upon error (since 0 is an invalid DIVQ value)
