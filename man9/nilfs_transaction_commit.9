\fBnilfs_transaction_commit\fP releases the read semaphore which is
acquired by \fBnilfs_transaction_begin\fP. This is only performed
in outermost call of this function.  If a commit flag is set,
\fBnilfs_transaction_commit\fP sets a timer to start the segment
constructor.  If a sync flag is set, it starts construction
directly.
