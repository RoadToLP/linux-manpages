.SH NAME
t4_intr_enable \- enable interrupts
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" t4_intr_enable
.BI "(struct adapter *adapter "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "adapter" 12
the adapter whose interrupts should be enabled

Enable PF-specific interrupts for the calling function and the top-level
interrupt concentrator for global interrupts.  Interrupts are already
enabled at each module, here we just enable the roots of the interrupt
hierarchies.
.SH "NOTE"
this function should be called only when the driver manages
non PF-specific interrupts from the various HW modules.  Only one PCI
function at a time should be doing this.
