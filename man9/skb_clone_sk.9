the skb to clone
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function creates a clone of a buffer that holds a reference on
sk_refcnt.  Buffers created via this function are meant to be
returned using sock_queue_err_skb, or free via kfree_skb.

When passing buffers allocated with this function to sock_queue_err_skb
it is necessary to wrap the call with sock_hold/sock_put in order to
prevent the socket from being released prior to being enqueued on
the sk_error_queue.
