.SH NAME

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" ide_acpi_exec_tfs
.BI "(ide_drive_t *drive "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "drive" 12
the drive for which the taskfile settings should be
written.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
According to the ACPI spec this should be called after _STM
has been evaluated for the interface. Some ACPI vendors interpret
that as a hard requirement and modify the taskfile according
to the Identify Drive information passed down with _STM.
So one should really make sure to call this only after _STM has
been executed.
