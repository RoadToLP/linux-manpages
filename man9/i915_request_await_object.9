.BI "(struct i915_request *to "  ","

.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "to" 12
request we are wishing to use
.IP "obj" 12
object which may be in use on another ring.
.IP "write" 12
whether the wait is on behalf of a writer
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This code is meant to abstract object synchronization with the GPU.
Conceptually we serialise writes between engines inside the GPU.
We only allow one engine to write into a buffer at any time, but
multiple readers. To ensure each has a coherent view of memory, we must:

- If there is an outstanding write request to the object, the new
request must wait for it to complete (either CPU or in hw, requests
on the same ring will be naturally ordered).

- If we are a write request (pending_write_domain is set), the new
request must wait for outstanding read requests to complete.

Returns 0 if successful, else propagates up the lower layer error.
