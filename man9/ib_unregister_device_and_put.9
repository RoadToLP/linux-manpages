.SH NAME
ib_unregister_device_and_put \- Unregister a device while holding a 'get'
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" ib_unregister_device_and_put
.BI "(struct ib_device *ib_dev "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "ib_dev" 12
The device to unregister
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This is the same as \fBib_unregister_device\fP, except it includes an internal
\fBib_device_put\fP that should match a 'get' obtained by the caller.

It is safe to call this routine concurrently from multiple threads while
holding the 'get'. When the function returns the device is fully
unregistered.

Drivers using this flow MUST use the driver_unregister callback to clean up
their resources associated with the device and dealloc it.
