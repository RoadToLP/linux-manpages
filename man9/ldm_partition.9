.SH NAME
ldm_partition \- Find out whether a device is a dynamic disk and handle it
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" ldm_partition
.BI "(struct parsed_partitions *state "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "state" 12
Partition check state including device holding the LDM Database
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This determines whether the device \fIbdev\fP is a dynamic disk and if so creates
the partitions necessary in the gendisk structure pointed to by \fIhd\fP.

We create a dummy device 1, which contains the LDM database, and then create
each partition described by the LDM database in sequence as devices 2+. For
example, if the device is hda, we would have: hda1: LDM database, hda2, hda3,
and so on: the actual data containing partitions.
.SH "RETURN"
1 Success, \fIstate->bdev\fP is a dynamic disk and we handled it
0 Success, \fIstate->bdev\fP is not a dynamic disk
-1 An error occurred before enough information had been read
Or \fIstate->bdev\fP is a dynamic disk, but it may be corrupted
