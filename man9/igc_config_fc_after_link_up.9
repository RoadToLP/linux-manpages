.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Checks the status of auto-negotiation after link up to ensure that the
speed and duplex were not forced.  If the link needed to be forced, then
flow control needs to be forced also.  If auto-negotiation is enabled
and did not fail, then we configure flow control based on our link
partner.
