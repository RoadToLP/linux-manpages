.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Attempt to add a page to the bio_vec maplist. This can fail for a
number of reasons, such as the bio being full or target block device
limitations. The target block device must allow bio's up to PAGE_SIZE,
so it is always possible to add a single page to an empty bio.

This should only be used by passthrough bios.
