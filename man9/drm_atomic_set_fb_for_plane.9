.SH NAME
drm_atomic_set_fb_for_plane \- set framebuffer for plane
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" drm_atomic_set_fb_for_plane
.BI "(struct drm_plane_state *plane_state "  ","
.BI "struct drm_framebuffer *fb "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "plane_state" 12
atomic state object for the plane
.IP "fb" 12
fb to use for the plane
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Changing the assigned framebuffer for a plane requires us to grab a reference
to the new fb and drop the reference to the old fb, if there is one. This
function takes care of all these details besides updating the pointer in the
state object itself.
