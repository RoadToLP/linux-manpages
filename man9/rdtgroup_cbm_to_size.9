.SH NAME
rdtgroup_cbm_to_size \- Translate CBM to size in bytes
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "unsigned int" rdtgroup_cbm_to_size
.BI "(struct rdt_resource *r "  ","
.BI "struct rdt_domain *d "  ","
.BI "unsigned long cbm "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "r" 12
RDT resource to which \fId\fP belongs.
.IP "d" 12
RDT domain instance.
.IP "cbm" 12
bitmask for which the size should be computed.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The bitmask provided associated with the RDT domain instance \fId\fP will be
translated into how many bytes it represents. The size in bytes is
computed by first dividing the total cache size by the CBM length to
determine how many bytes each bit in the bitmask represents. The result
is multiplied with the number of bits set in the bitmask.

\fIcbm\fP is unsigned long, even if only 32 bits are used to make the
bitmap functions work correctly.
