.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Combine available XPD Curves and fill Linear Power to PCDAC table on RF5112
RFX112 can have up to 2 curves (one for low txpower range and one for
higher txpower range). We need to put them both on pcdac_out and place
them in the correct location. In case we only have one curve available
just fit it on pcdac_out (it's supposed to cover the entire range of
available pwr levels since it's always the higher power curve). Extrapolate
below and above final table if needed.
