.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function is called by garbage collection to determine if commit should
be run. If commit state is \fICOMMIT_BACKGROUND\fP, which means that the journal
is full enough to start commit, this function returns true. It is not
absolutely necessary to commit yet, but it feels like this should be better
then to keep doing GC. This function returns 1 if GC has to initiate commit
and 0 if not.
