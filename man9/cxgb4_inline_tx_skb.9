.SH NAME
cxgb4_inline_tx_skb \- inline a packet's data into Tx descriptors
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" cxgb4_inline_tx_skb
.BI "(const struct sk_buff *skb "  ","
.BI "const struct sge_txq *q "  ","
.BI "void *pos "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "skb" 12
the packet
.IP "q" 12
the Tx queue where the packet will be inlined
.IP "pos" 12
starting position in the Tx queue where to inline the packet

Inline a packet's contents directly into Tx descriptors, starting at
the given position within the Tx DMA ring.
Most of the complexity of this operation is dealing with wrap arounds
in the middle of the packet we want to inline.
