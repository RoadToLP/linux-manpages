.SH "DESCRIPTION"
unflattens the device-tree passed by the firmware, creating the
tree of struct device_node. It also fills the "name" and "type"
pointers of the nodes so the normal device-tree walking functions
can be used.

Returns NULL on failure or the memory chunk containing the unflattened
device tree on success.
