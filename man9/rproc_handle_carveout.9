.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function will handle firmware requests for allocation of physically
contiguous memory regions.

These request entries should come first in the firmware's resource table,
as other firmware entries might request placing other data objects inside
these memory regions (e.g. data/code segments, trace resource entries, ...).

Allocating memory this way helps utilizing the reserved physical memory
(e.g. CMA) more efficiently, and also minimizes the number of TLB entries
needed to map it (in case \fIrproc\fP is using an IOMMU). Reducing the TLB
pressure is important; it may have a substantial impact on performance.
