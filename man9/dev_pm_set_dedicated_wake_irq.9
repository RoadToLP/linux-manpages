.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Unless your hardware has separate wake-up interrupts in addition
to the device IO interrupts, you don't need this.

Sets up a threaded interrupt handler for a device that has
a dedicated wake-up interrupt in addition to the device IO
interrupt.

The interrupt starts disabled, and needs to be managed for
the device by the bus code or the device driver using
\fBdev_pm_enable_wake_irq\fP and \fBdev_pm_disable_wake_irq\fP
functions.
