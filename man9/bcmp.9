.SH NAME
bcmp \- returns 0 if and only if the buffers have identical contents.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" bcmp
.BI "(const void *a "  ","
.BI "const void *b "  ","
.BI "size_t len "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "a" 12
pointer to first buffer.
.IP "b" 12
pointer to second buffer.
.IP "len" 12
size of buffers.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The sign or magnitude of a non-zero return value has no particular
meaning, and architectures may implement their own more efficient \fBbcmp\fP. So
while this particular implementation is a simple (tail) call to memcmp, do
not rely on anything but whether the return value is zero or non-zero.
