NVM structure
.IP "size" 12
Size of the non-active NVM in bytes
.IP "reg_write" 12
Pointer to the function to write the NVM (passed directly

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Registers new non-active NVmem device for \fInvm\fP. The \fIreg_write\fP is called

needed. The first parameter passed to \fIreg_write\fP is \fInvm\fP structure.
Returns 0 in success and negative errno otherwise.
