WiMAX device descriptor
.IP "state" 12
New state of the RF kill switch. WIMAX_RF_ON radio on,
WIMAX_RF_OFF radio off.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Reports changes in the software RF switch state to the WiMAX stack.

The main use is during initialization, so the driver can query the
device for its current software radio kill switch state and feed it
to the system.

On the side, the device does not change the software state by
itself. In practice, this can happen, as the device might decide to
switch (in software) the radio off for different reasons.
