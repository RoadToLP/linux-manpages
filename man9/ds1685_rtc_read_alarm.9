.SH "DESCRIPTION"
There are three primary alarm registers: seconds, minutes, and hours.
A fourth alarm register for the month date is also available in bank1 for
kickstart/wakeup features.  The DS1685/DS1687 manual states that a
"don't care" value ranging from 0xc0 to 0xff may be written into one or
more of the three alarm bytes to act as a wildcard value.  The fourth
byte doesn't support a "don't care" value.
