.BI "(struct e1000_hw *hw "  ","
.BI "u16 *phy_ctrl "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "hw" 12
pointer to the HW structure
.IP "phy_ctrl" 12
pointer to current value of MII_BMCR

Forces speed and duplex on the PHY by doing the following: disable flow
control, force speed/duplex on the MAC, disable auto speed detection,
disable auto-negotiation, configure duplex, configure speed, configure
the collision distance, write configuration to CTRL register.  The
