.SH NAME
t4vf_change_mac \- modifies the exact-match filter for a MAC address
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" t4vf_change_mac
.BI "(struct adapter *adapter "  ","
.BI "unsigned int viid "  ","
.BI "int idx "  ","
.BI "const u8 *addr "  ","
.BI "bool persist "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "adapter" 12
the adapter
.IP "viid" 12
the Virtual Interface ID
.IP "idx" 12
index of existing filter for old value of MAC address, or -1
.IP "addr" 12
the new MAC address value
.IP "persist" 12
if idx < 0, the new MAC allocation should be persistent

Modifies an exact-match filter and sets it to the new MAC address.
Note that in general it is not possible to modify the value of a given
filter so the generic way to modify an address filter is to free the
one being used by the old address value and allocate a new filter for
the new address value.  \fIidx\fP can be -1 if the address is a new
addition.

Returns a negative error number or the index of the filter with the new
MAC value.
