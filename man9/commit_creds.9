.SH NAME
commit_creds \- Install new credentials upon the current task
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" commit_creds
.BI "(struct cred *new "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "new" 12
The credentials to be assigned
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Install a new set of credentials to the current task, using RCU to replace
the old set.  Both the objective and the subjective credentials pointers are
updated.  This function may not be called if the subjective credentials are
in an overridden state.

This function eats the caller's reference to the new credentials.

Always returns 0 thus allowing this function to be tail-called at the end
of, say, \fBsys_setgid\fP.
