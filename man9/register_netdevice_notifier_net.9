.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Register a notifier to be called when network device events occur.
The notifier passed is linked into the kernel structures and must
not be reused until it has been unregistered. A negative errno code
is returned on a failure.

When registered all registration and up events are replayed
to the new notifier to allow device to have a race free
view of the network device list.
