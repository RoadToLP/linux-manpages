.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The thread group cputime accouting is avoided when there are no posix
CPU timers armed. Before starting a timer it's required to check whether
the time accounting is active. If not, a full update of the atomic
accounting store needs to be done and the accounting enabled.

Updates \fItimes\fP with an uptodate sample of the thread group cputimes.
