.SH NAME
drm_atomic_helper_cleanup_planes \- cleanup plane resources after commit
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" drm_atomic_helper_cleanup_planes
.BI "(struct drm_device *dev "  ","
.BI "struct drm_atomic_state *old_state "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dev" 12
DRM device
.IP "old_state" 12
atomic state object with old state structures
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function cleans up plane state, specifically framebuffers, from the old
configuration. Hence the old configuration must be perserved in \fIold_state\fP to
be able to call this function.

This function must also be called on the new state when the atomic update
fails at any point after calling \fBdrm_atomic_helper_prepare_planes\fP.
