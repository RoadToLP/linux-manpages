.SH "DESCRIPTION"
If the FS is already enabled with a previous call the classification
key will be changed but all the table rules are kept. If the
existing rules do not match the key the results will not be
predictable. It is the user responsibility to keep key integrity.
If cfg.enable is set to 1 the command will create a flow steering table
and will classify packets according to this table. The packets that
miss all the table rules will be classified according to settings
made in \fBdpni_set_rx_hash_dist\fP
If cfg.enable is set to 0 the command will clear flow steering table.
The packets will be classified according to settings made in
\fBdpni_set_rx_hash_dist\fP
