.IP "r" 12
pointer to array of linear ranges where selector is looked from
.IP "ranges" 12
amount of ranges to scan from array
.IP "val" 12
value for which the selector is searched
.IP "selector" 12
address where found selector value is updated
.IP "found" 12
flag to indicate that given value was in the range
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Scan array of ranges for selector for which range value matches given
input value. Value is matching if it is equal or smaller than given
value. If given value is found to be in a range scanning is stopped and
\fIfound\fP is set true. If a range with values smaller than given value is found
but the range max is being smaller than given value, then the range's
biggest selector is updated to \fIselector\fP but scanning ranges is continued
and \fIfound\fP is set to false.
.SH "RETURN"
0 on success, -EINVAL if range array is invalid or does not contain
