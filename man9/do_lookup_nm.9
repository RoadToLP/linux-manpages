.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function looks up and reads a node which contains name hash in the key.
Since the hash may have collisions, there may be many nodes with the same
key, so we have to sequentially look to all of them until the needed one is
found. This function returns zero in case of success, -ENOENT if the node
was not found, and a negative error code in case of failure.
