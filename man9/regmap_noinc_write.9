.SH NAME
regmap_noinc_write \- Write data from a register without incrementing the register number
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" regmap_noinc_write
.BI "(struct regmap *map "  ","
.BI "unsigned int reg "  ","
.BI "const void *val "  ","
.BI "size_t val_len "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "map" 12
Register map to write to
.IP "reg" 12
Register to write to
.IP "val" 12
Pointer to data buffer
.IP "val_len" 12
Length of output buffer in bytes.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The regmap API usually assumes that bulk bus write operations will write a
range of registers. Some devices have certain registers for which a write
operation can write to an internal FIFO.

The target register must be volatile but registers after it can be
completely unrelated cacheable registers.

This will attempt multiple writes as required to write val_len bytes.

A value of zero will be returned on success, a negative errno will be
returned in error cases.
