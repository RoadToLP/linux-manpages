.SH NAME
throttlectl_cpu_mn \- program CPU pulse skipper configuration
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" throttlectl_cpu_mn
.BI "(struct tegra_soctherm *ts "  ","
.BI "enum soctherm_throttle_id throt "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "ts" 12
pointer to a struct tegra_soctherm
.IP "throt" 12
the LIGHT/HEAVY of throttle event id
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Pulse skippers are used to throttle clock frequencies.  This
function programs the pulse skippers based on \fIthrot\fP and platform
data.  This function is used for CPUs that have "remote" pulse
skipper control, e.g., the CPU pulse skipper is controlled by the
SOC_THERM IP block.  (SOC_THERM is located outside the CPU
complex.)
