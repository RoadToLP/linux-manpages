LEB the write-buffer was synchronized to
.IP "free" 12
how many free bytes left in this LEB
.IP "pad" 12
how many bytes were padded
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This is a callback function which is called by the I/O unit when the
write-buffer is synchronized. We need this to correctly maintain space
accounting in bud logical eraseblocks. This function returns zero in case of
success and a negative error code in case of failure.

This function actually belongs to the journal, but we keep it here because
we want to keep it static.
