.SH NAME
pdcspath_store \- This function writes a path to stable storage.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" pdcspath_store
.BI "(struct pdcspath_entry *entry "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "entry" 12
A pointer to an allocated pdcspath_entry.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
It can be used in two ways: either by passing it a preset devpath struct
containing an already computed hardware path, or by passing it a device
pointer, from which it'll find out the corresponding hardware path.
For now we do not handle the case where there's an error in writing to the
Stable Storage area, so you'd better not mess up the data :P

This function expects to be called with \fIentry->rw_lock\fP write-hold.
