.SH NAME
usb_init_urb \- initializes a urb so that it can be used by a USB driver
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" usb_init_urb
.BI "(struct urb *urb "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "urb" 12
pointer to the urb to initialize
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Initializes a urb so that the USB subsystem can use it properly.

If a urb is created with a call to \fBusb_alloc_urb\fP it is not
necessary to call this function.  Only use this if you allocate the
space for a struct urb on your own.  If you call this function, be
careful when freeing the memory for your urb that it is no longer in
use by the USB core.

Only use this function if you _really_ understand what you are doing.
