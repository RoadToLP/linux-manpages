.SH "DESCRIPTION"
A few devices or drivers have problem to detect some standard variations.
On other operational systems, the drivers generally have a per-country
code, and some logic to apply per-country hacks. V4L2 API doesn't provide
such hacks. Instead, it relies on a proper video standard selection from
the userspace application. However, as some apps are buggy, not allowing
to distinguish all video standard variations, a modprobe parameter can
be used to force a video standard match.
