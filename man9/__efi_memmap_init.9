EFI memory map data
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function takes care of figuring out which function to use to
map the EFI memory map in efi.memmap based on how far into the boot
we are.

During bootup EFI_MEMMAP_LATE in data->flags should be clear since we
only have access to the early_memremap*() functions as the vmalloc
space isn't setup.  Once the kernel is fully booted we can fallback
to the more robust memremap*() API.

Returns zero on success, a negative error code on failure.
