.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function creates a mailbox queue, as detailed in \fImq\fP, on a port,
described by \fIphba\fP by sending a MQ_CREATE mailbox command to the HBA.

The \fIphba\fP struct is used to send mailbox command to HBA. The \fIcq\fP struct
is used to get the entry count and entry size that are necessary to
determine the number of pages to allocate and use for this queue. This
function will send the MQ_CREATE mailbox command to the HBA to setup the
mailbox queue. This function is asynchronous and will wait for the mailbox
command to finish before continuing.

On success this function will return a zero. If unable to allocate enough
memory this function will return -ENOMEM. If the queue create mailbox command
fails this function will return -ENXIO.
