.SH NAME
lpfc_els_rcv_rtv \- Process an unsolicited rtv iocb
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" lpfc_els_rcv_rtv
.BI "(struct lpfc_vport *vport "  ","
.BI "struct lpfc_iocbq *cmdiocb "  ","
.BI "struct lpfc_nodelist *ndlp "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "vport" 12
pointer to a host virtual N_Port data structure.
.IP "cmdiocb" 12
pointer to lpfc command iocb data structure.
.IP "ndlp" 12
pointer to a node-list data structure.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This routine processes Read Timout Value (RTV) IOCB received as an
ELS unsolicited event. It first checks the remote port state. If the
remote port is not in NLP_STE_UNMAPPED_NODE state or NLP_STE_MAPPED_NODE
state, it invokes the \fBlpfc_els_rsl_reject\fP routine to send the reject
response. Otherwise, it sends the Accept(ACC) response to a Read Timeout
Value (RTV) unsolicited IOCB event.

Note that, in \fBlpfc_prep_els_iocb\fP routine, the reference count of ndlp
will be incremented by 1 for holding the ndlp and the reference to ndlp
will be stored into the context1 field of the IOCB for the completion
callback function to the RTV Accept Response ELS IOCB command.

Return codes
0 - Successfully processed rtv iocb (currently always return 0)
