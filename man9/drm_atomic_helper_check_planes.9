.SH NAME
drm_atomic_helper_check_planes \- validate state object for planes changes
.SH SYNOPSIS

.BI "(struct drm_device *dev "  ","
.BI "struct drm_atomic_state *state "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dev" 12
DRM device
.IP "state" 12
the driver state object
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Check the state object to see if the requested state is physically possible.
This does all the plane update related checks using by calling into the
\fIdrm_crtc_helper_funcs.atomic_check\fP and \fIdrm_plane_helper_funcs.atomic_check\fP
hooks provided by the driver.

It also sets \fIdrm_crtc_state.planes_changed\fP to indicate that a CRTC has
updated planes.
.SH "RETURN"
