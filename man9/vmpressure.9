.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function should be called from the vmscan reclaim path to account
"instantaneous" memory pressure (scanned/reclaimed ratio). The raw
pressure index is then further refined and averaged over time.

If \fItree\fP is set, vmpressure is in traditional userspace reporting
mode: \fImemcg\fP is considered the pressure root and userspace is
notified of the entire subtree's reclaim efficiency.

If \fItree\fP is not set, reclaim efficiency is recorded for \fImemcg\fP, and
only in-kernel users are notified.

This function does not return any value.
