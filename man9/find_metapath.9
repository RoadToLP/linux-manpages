.SH NAME
find_metapath \- Find path through the metadata tree
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" find_metapath
.BI "(const struct gfs2_sbd *sdp "  ","
.BI "u64 block "  ","
.BI "struct metapath *mp "  ","
.BI "unsigned int height "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "sdp" 12
The superblock
.IP "block" 12
The disk block to look up
.IP "mp" 12
The metapath to return the result in
.IP "height" 12
The pre-calculated height of the metadata tree

This routine returns a struct metapath structure that defines a path
through the metadata of inode "ip" to get to block "block".
.SH "EXAMPLE"
Given:  "ip" is a height 3 file, "offset" is 101342453, and this is a
filesystem with a blocksize of 4096.

\fBfind_metapath\fP would return a struct metapath structure set to:
mp_fheight = 3, mp_list[0] = 0, mp_list[1] = 48, and mp_list[2] = 165.

That means that in order to get to the block containing the byte at
offset 101342453, we would load the indirect block pointed to by pointer
0 in the dinode.  We would then load the indirect block pointed to by
pointer 48 in that indirect block.  We would then load the data block
pointed to by pointer 165 in that indirect block.
