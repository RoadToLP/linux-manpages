.BI "phys_addr_t new_area_start "  ","
.BI "phys_addr_t new_area_size "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "type" 12
memblock type of the regions array being doubled
.IP "new_area_start" 12
starting address of memory range to avoid overlap with
.IP "new_area_size" 12
size of memory range to avoid overlap with
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Double the size of the \fItype\fP regions array. If memblock is being used to
allocate memory for a new reserved regions array and there is a previously
allocated memory range [\fInew_area_start\fP, \fInew_area_start\fP + \fInew_area_size\fP]
waiting to be reserved, ensure the memory used by the new array does
not overlap.
.SH "RETURN"
0 on success, -1 on failure.
