.SH NAME
rpc_localaddr \- discover local endpoint address for an RPC client
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" rpc_localaddr
.BI "(struct rpc_clnt *clnt "  ","
.BI "struct sockaddr *buf "  ","
.BI "size_t buflen "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "clnt" 12
RPC client structure
.IP "buf" 12
target buffer
.IP "buflen" 12
size of target buffer, in bytes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Returns zero and fills in "buf" and "buflen" if successful;
otherwise, a negative errno is returned.

This works even if the underlying transport is not currently connected,
or if the upper layer never previously provided a source address.

The result of this function call is transient: multiple calls in
succession may give different results, depending on how local
networking configuration changes over time.
