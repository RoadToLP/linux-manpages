.SH NAME
bcm63xx_ep0_process \- ep0 worker thread / state machine.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" bcm63xx_ep0_process
.BI "(struct work_struct *w "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "w" 12
Workqueue struct.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
bcm63xx_ep0_process is triggered any time an event occurs on ep0.  It
is used to synchronize ep0 events and ensure that both HW and SW events
occur in a well-defined order.  When the ep0 IUDMA queues are idle, it may
synthesize SET_CONFIGURATION / SET_INTERFACE requests that were consumed
by the USBD hardware.

The worker function will continue iterating around the state machine
until there is nothing left to do.  Usually "nothing left to do" means
that we're waiting for a new event from the hardware.
