thread to decrement
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
A thread needs to be kept alive while being used to create or
handle a transaction. \fBbinder_get_txn_from\fP is used to safely
extract t->from from a binder_transaction and keep the thread
indicated by t->from from being freed. When done with that
binder_thread, this function is called to decrement the
tmp_ref and free if appropriate (thread has been released
and no transaction being processed by the driver)
