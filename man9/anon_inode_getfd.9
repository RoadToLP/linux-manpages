.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Creates a new file by hooking it on a single inode. This is
useful for files that do not need to have a full-fledged inode in
order to operate correctly.  All the files created with
\fBanon_inode_getfd\fP will use the same singleton inode, reducing
memory use and avoiding code duplication for the file/inode/dentry
setup.  Returns a newly created file descriptor or an error code.
