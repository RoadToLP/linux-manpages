.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function has to be called when UBIFS starts the commit operation.
This function "freezes" all currently dirty LEB properties and does not
change them anymore. Further changes are saved and tracked separately
because they are not part of this commit. This function returns zero in case
of success and a negative error code in case of failure.
