.SH NAME
drm_irq_install \- install IRQ handler
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" drm_irq_install
.BI "(struct drm_device *dev "  ","
.BI "int irq "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dev" 12
DRM device
.IP "irq" 12
IRQ number to install the handler for
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Initializes the IRQ related data. Installs the handler, calling the driver
\fIdrm_driver.irq_preinstall\fP and \fIdrm_driver.irq_postinstall\fP functions before
and after the installation.

This is the simplified helper interface provided for drivers with no special
needs. Drivers which need to install interrupt handlers for multiple
interrupts must instead set \fIdrm_device.irq_enabled\fP to signal the DRM core
that vblank interrupts are available.

\fIirq\fP must match the interrupt number that would be passed to \fBrequest_irq\fP,
if called directly instead of using this helper function.

\fIdrm_driver.irq_handler\fP is called to handle the registered interrupt.
.SH "RETURN"
Zero on success or a negative error code on failure.
