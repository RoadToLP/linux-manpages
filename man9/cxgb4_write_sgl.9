.SH NAME
cxgb4_write_sgl \- populate a scatter/gather list for a packet
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" cxgb4_write_sgl
.BI "(const struct sk_buff *skb "  ","
.BI "struct sge_txq *q "  ","
.BI "struct ulptx_sgl *sgl "  ","
.BI "u64 *end "  ","
.BI "unsigned int start "  ","
.BI "const dma_addr_t *addr "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "skb" 12
the packet
.IP "q" 12
the Tx queue we are writing into
.IP "sgl" 12
starting location for writing the SGL
.IP "end" 12
points right after the end of the SGL
.IP "start" 12
start offset into skb main-body data to include in the SGL
.IP "addr" 12
the list of bus addresses for the SGL elements

Generates a gather list for the buffers that make up a packet.
The caller must provide adequate space for the SGL that will be written.
The SGL includes all of the packet's page fragments and the data in its
main body except for the first \fIstart\fP bytes.  \fIsgl\fP must be 16-byte
aligned and within a Tx descriptor with available space.  \fIend\fP points
right after the end of the SGL but does not account for any potential
wrap around, i.e., \fIend\fP > \fIsgl\fP.
