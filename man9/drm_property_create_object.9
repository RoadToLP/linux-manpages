.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This creates a new generic drm property which can then be attached to a drm
object with \fBdrm_object_attach_property\fP. The returned property object must
be freed with \fBdrm_property_destroy\fP, which is done automatically when
calling \fBdrm_mode_config_cleanup\fP.

Userspace is only allowed to set this to any property value of the given
\fItype\fP. Only useful for atomic properties, which is enforced.
.SH "RETURN"
A pointer to the newly created property on success, NULL on failure.
