.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function reads a node of known type and length, checks it and stores
in \fIbuf\fP. If the node partially or fully sits in the write-buffer, this
function takes data from the buffer, otherwise it reads the flash media.
Returns zero in case of success, -EUCLEAN if CRC mismatched and a negative
error code in case of failure.
