.SH "DESCRIPTION"

On SMP systems, we need to get the attention of the other CPUs
and get them be in a known state.  This should do what is needed
to get the other CPUs to call \fBkgdb_wait\fP. Note that on some arches,
the NMI approach is not used for rounding up all the CPUs. For example,
in case of MIPS, \fBsmp_call_function\fP is used to roundup CPUs.

On non-SMP systems, this is not called.
