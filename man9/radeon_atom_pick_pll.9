.SH NAME
radeon_atom_pick_pll \- Allocate a PPLL for use by the crtc.
.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Returns the PPLL (Pixel PLL) to be used by the crtc.  For DP monitors
a single PPLL can be used for all DP crtcs/encoders.  For non-DP
monitors a dedicated PPLL must be used.  If a particular board has
an external DP PLL, return ATOM_PPLL_INVALID to skip PLL programming
as there is no need to program the PLL itself.  If we are not able to
allocate a PLL, return ATOM_PPLL_INVALID to skip PLL programming to
avoid messing up an existing monitor.
