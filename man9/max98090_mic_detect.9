.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Enable microphone detection via IRQ on the MAX98090.  If GPIOs are
being used to bring out signals to the processor then only platform
data configuration is needed for MAX98090 and processor GPIOs should
be configured using \fBsnd_soc_jack_add_gpios\fP instead.

If no jack is supplied detection will be disabled.
