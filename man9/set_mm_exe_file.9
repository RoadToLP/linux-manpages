.SH "DESCRIPTION"

This changes mm's executable file (shown as symlink /proc/[pid]/exe).

Main users are \fBmmput\fP and \fBsys_execve\fP. Callers prevent concurrent
invocations: in \fBmmput\fP nobody alive left, in execve task is single
threaded. sys_prctl(PR_SET_MM_MAP/EXE_FILE) also needs to set the
mm->exe_file, but does so without using \fBset_mm_exe_file\fP in order
to do avoid the need for any locks.
