.SH NAME
range_shrink \- Shrinks an ashmem_range
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" range_shrink
.BI "(struct ashmem_range *range "  ","
.BI "size_t start "  ","
.BI "size_t end "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "range" 12
The associated ashmem_range being shrunk
.IP "start" 12
The starting byte of the new range
.IP "end" 12
The ending byte of the new range
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This does not modify the data inside the existing range in any way - It
simply shrinks the boundaries of the range.

Theoretically, with a little tweaking, this could eventually be changed
to range_resize, and expand the lru_count if the new range is larger.
