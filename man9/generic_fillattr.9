Where to fill in the attributes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Fill in the basic attributes in the kstat structure from data that's to be
found on the VFS inode structure.  This is the default if no getattr inode
operation is supplied.

If the inode has been found through an idmapped mount the user namespace of
the vfsmount must be passed through \fImnt_userns\fP. This function will then
take care to map the inode according to \fImnt_userns\fP before filling in the
uid and gid filds. On non-idmapped mounts or if permission checking is to be
performed on the raw inode simply passs init_user_ns.
