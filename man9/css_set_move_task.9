.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Move \fItask\fP from \fIfrom_cset\fP to \fIto_cset\fP.  If \fItask\fP didn't belong to any
css_set, \fIfrom_cset\fP can be NULL.  If \fItask\fP is being disassociated
instead of moved, \fIto_cset\fP can be NULL.

This function automatically handles populated counter updates and
css_task_iter adjustments but the caller is responsible for managing
\fIfrom_cset\fP and \fIto_cset\fP's reference counts.
