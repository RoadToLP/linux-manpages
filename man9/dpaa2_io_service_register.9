.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The caller should make the MC command to attach a DPAA2 object to
a DPIO after this function completes successfully.  In that way:
(a) The DPIO service is "ready" to handle a notification arrival
(which might happen before the "attach" command to MC has
returned control of execution back to the caller)
(b) The DPIO service can provide back to the caller the 'dpio_id' and
'qman64' parameters that it should pass along in the MC command
in order for the object to be configured to produce the right
notification fields to the DPIO service.

Return 0 for success, or -ENODEV for failure.
