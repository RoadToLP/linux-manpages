the requested link configuration

Set up a port's MAC and PHY according to a desired link configuration.
- If the PHY can auto-negotiate first decide what to advertise, then
enable/disable auto-negotiation as desired, and reset.
- If the PHY does not auto-negotiate just reset it.
- If auto-negotiation is off set the MAC to the proper speed/duplex/FC,
otherwise do it later based on the outcome of auto-negotiation.
