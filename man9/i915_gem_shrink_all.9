.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This is a simple wraper around \fBi915_gem_shrink\fP to aggressively shrink all
caches completely. It also first waits for and retires all outstanding
requests to also be able to release backing storage for active objects.

This should only be used in code to intentionally quiescent the gpu or as a
last-ditch effort when memory seems to have run out.
.SH "RETURN"
The number of pages of backing storage actually released.
