.SH NAME
vmw_cotable_create \- Cotable resource create callback
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" vmw_cotable_create
.BI "(struct vmw_resource *res "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "res" 12
Pointer to a cotable resource.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
There is no separate create command for cotables, so this callback, which
is called before \fBbind\fP in the validation sequence is instead used for two
things.
1) Unscrub the cotable if it is scrubbed and still attached to a backup
buffer.
2) Resize the cotable if needed.
