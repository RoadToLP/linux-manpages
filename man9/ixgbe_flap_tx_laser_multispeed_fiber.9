pointer to hardware structure

When the driver changes the link speeds that it can support,
it sets autotry_restart to true to indicate that we need to
initiate a new autotry session with the link partner.  To do
so, we set the speed then disable and re-enable the tx laser, to
alert the link partner that it also needs to restart autotry on its
end.  This is consistent with true clause 37 autoneg, which also
involves a loss of signal.
