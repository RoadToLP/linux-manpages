.BI "(struct device *dev "  ","
.BI "char *name "  ","
.BI "int len "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dev" 12
driver model representation of the device.
.IP "name" 12
device name buffer reference.
.IP "len" 12

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
In effect this function matches an ID to an internal kernel
name for a certain sensor device, so that the rest of the autodetection can
rely on that name from this point on. I2C/SPI devices will be renamed
to match the internal kernel convention.
