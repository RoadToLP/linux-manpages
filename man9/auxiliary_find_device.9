.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function returns a reference to a device that is 'found'
for later use, as determined by the \fImatch\fP callback.

The callback should return 0 if the device doesn't match and non-zero
if it does.  If the callback returns non-zero, this function will
return to the caller and not iterate over any more devices.
