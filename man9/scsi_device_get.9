device to get a reference to
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Gets a reference to the scsi_device and increments the use count
of the underlying LLDD module.  You must hold host_lock of the
parent Scsi_Host or already have a reference when calling this.

This will fail if a device is deleted or cancelled, or when the LLD module
is in the process of being unloaded.
