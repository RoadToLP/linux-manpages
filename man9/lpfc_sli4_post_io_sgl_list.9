.SH NAME
lpfc_sli4_post_io_sgl_list \- Post blocks of nvme buffer sgls from a list
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" lpfc_sli4_post_io_sgl_list
.BI "(struct lpfc_hba *phba "  ","
.BI "struct list_head *post_nblist "  ","
.BI "int sb_count "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "phba" 12
pointer to lpfc hba data structure.
.IP "post_nblist" 12
pointer to the nvme buffer list.
.IP "sb_count" 12
number of nvme buffers.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This routine walks a list of nvme buffers that was passed in. It attempts
to construct blocks of nvme buffer sgls which contains contiguous xris and
uses the non-embedded SGL block post mailbox commands to post to the port.
For single NVME buffer sgl with non-contiguous xri, if any, it shall use
embedded SGL post mailbox command for posting. The \fIpost_nblist\fP passed in
must be local list, thus no lock is needed when manipulate the list.
.SH "RETURN"
0 = failure, non-zero number of successfully posted buffers.
