.SH NAME
ti_iodelay_pinconf_set \- Configure the pin configuration
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" ti_iodelay_pinconf_set
.BI "(struct ti_iodelay_device *iod "  ","
.BI "struct ti_iodelay_cfg *cfg "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "iod" 12
iodelay device
.IP "cfg" 12
Configuration
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Update the configuration register as per TRM and lockup once done.
*IMPORTANT NOTE* SoC TRM does recommend doing iodelay programmation only
while in Isolation. But, then, isolation also implies that every pin
on the SoC (including DDR) will be isolated out. The only benefit being
a glitchless configuration, However, the intent of this driver is purely
to support a "glitchy" configuration where applicable.
.SH "RETURN"
0 in case of success, else appropriate error value
