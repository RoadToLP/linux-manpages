.SH NAME
pbus_size_io \- Size the I/O window of a given bus
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" pbus_size_io
.BI "(struct pci_bus *bus "  ","
.BI "resource_size_t min_size "  ","
.BI "resource_size_t add_size "  ","
.BI "struct list_head *realloc_head "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "bus" 12
The bus
.IP "min_size" 12
The minimum I/O window that must be allocated
.IP "add_size" 12
Additional optional I/O window
.IP "realloc_head" 12
Track the additional I/O window on this list
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Sizing the I/O windows of the PCI-PCI bridge is trivial, since these
windows have 1K or 4K granularity and the I/O ranges of non-bridge PCI
devices are limited to 256 bytes.  We must be careful with the ISA
aliasing though.
