resource group needing access restricted
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
A resource group used for cache pseudo-locking cannot have cpus or tasks
assigned to it. This is communicated to the user by restricting access
to all the files that can be used to make such changes.

Permissions restored with \fBrdtgroup_locksetup_user_restore\fP
.SH "RETURN"
0 on success, <0 on failure. If a failure occurs during the
restriction of access an attempt will be made to restore permissions but
the state of the mode of these files will be uncertain when a failure
occurs.
