Client to register
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Upper level users of the IB drivers can use \fBib_register_client\fP to
register callbacks for IB device addition and removal.  When an IB
device is added, each registered client's add method will be called
(in the order the clients were registered), and when a device is
removed, each client's remove method will be called (in the reverse
order that clients were registered).  In addition, when
\fBib_register_client\fP is called, the client will receive an add
callback for all devices already registered.
