.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Returns a reference to the SSAM controller of the system or NULL if there
is none, it hasn't been set up yet, or it has already been unregistered.
This function automatically increments the reference count of the
controller, thus the calling party must ensure that \fBssam_controller_put\fP
is called when it doesn't need the controller any more.
