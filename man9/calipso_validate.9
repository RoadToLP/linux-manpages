.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This routine is called to validate a CALIPSO option.
If the option is valid then true is returned, otherwise
false is returned.

The caller should have already checked that the length of the
option (including the TLV header) is >= 10 and that the catmap
length is consistent with the option length.

We leave checks on the level and categories to the socket layer.
