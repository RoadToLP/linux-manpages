The SCSI command which timed out
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This routine protects against error handlers getting invoked while a
rport is in a blocked state, typically due to a temporarily loss of
connectivity. If the error handlers are allowed to proceed, requests
to abort i/o, reset the target, etc will likely fail as there is no way
to communicate with the device to perform the requested function. These
failures may result in the midlayer taking the device offline, requiring
manual intervention to restore operation.

This routine, called whenever an i/o times out, validates the state of
the underlying rport. If the rport is blocked, it returns
EH_RESET_TIMER, which will continue to reschedule the timeout.
Eventually, either the device will return, or devloss_tmo will fire,
and when the timeout then fires, it will be handled normally.
If the rport is not blocked, normal error handling continues.
.SH "NOTES"
This routine assumes no locks are held on entry.
