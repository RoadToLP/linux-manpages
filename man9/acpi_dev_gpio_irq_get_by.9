.SH NAME
acpi_dev_gpio_irq_get_by \- Find GpioInt and translate it to Linux IRQ number
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" acpi_dev_gpio_irq_get_by
.BI "(struct acpi_device *adev "  ","
.BI "const char *name "  ","
.BI "int index "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "adev" 12
pointer to a ACPI device to get IRQ from
.IP "name" 12
optional name of GpioInt resource
.IP "index" 12
index of GpioInt resource (starting from 0)
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
If the device has one or more GpioInt resources, this function can be
used to translate from the GPIO offset in the resource to the Linux IRQ
number.

The function is idempotent, though each time it runs it will configure GPIO
pin direction according to the flags in GpioInt resource.

The function takes optional \fIname\fP parameter. If the resource has a property
name, then only those will be taken into account.
.SH "RETURN"
Linux IRQ number (> 0) on success, negative errno on failure.
