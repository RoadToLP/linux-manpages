.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Clear the PHY error counters as soon as possible, since this might be called
from a MIB interrupt and we want to make sure we don't get interrupted again.
Add the count of CCK and OFDM errors to our internal state, so it can be used
by the algorithm later.

Will be called from interrupt and tasklet context.
Returns 0 if both counters are zero.
