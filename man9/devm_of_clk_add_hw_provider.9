.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" devm_of_clk_add_hw_provider
.BI "(struct device *dev "  ","
.BI "struct clk_hw *(*get)(struct of_phandle_args *clkspec, void *data) "  ","
.BI "void *data "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dev" 12
Device acting as the clock provider (used for DT node and lifetime)
.IP "get" 12
callback for decoding clk_hw
.IP "data" 12
context pointer for \fIget\fP callback
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Registers clock provider for given device's node. If the device has no DT
node or if the device node lacks of clock provider information (#clock-cells)
then the parent device's node is scanned for this information. If parent node
has the #clock-cells then it is used in registration. Provider is
automatically released at device exit.
