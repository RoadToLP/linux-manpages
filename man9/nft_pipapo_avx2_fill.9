.SH SYNOPSIS

.BI "(unsigned long *data "  ","
.BI "int start "  ","
.BI "int len "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "data" 12
Base memory area
.IP "start" 12

.IP "len" 12
Count of bits to fill
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This is nothing else than a version of \fBbitmap_set\fP, as used e.g. by
\fBpipapo_refill\fP, tailored for the microarchitectures using it and better
suited for the specific usage: it's very likely that we'll set a small number
of bits, not crossing a word boundary, and correct branch prediction is
critical here.

This function doesn't actually use any AVX2 instruction.
