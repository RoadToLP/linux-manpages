.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" gsm_dlci_t1
.BI "(struct timer_list *t "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "t" 12
timer contained in the DLCI that opened

The T1 timer handles retransmits of control frames (essentially of
SABM and DISC). We resend the command until the retry count runs out
in which case an opening port goes back to closed and a closing port
is simply put into closed state (any further frames from the other
end will get a DM response)

Some control dlci can stay in ADM mode with other dlci working just
fine. In that case we can just keep the control dlci open after the
DLCI_OPENING retries time out.
