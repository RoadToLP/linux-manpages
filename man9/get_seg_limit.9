.SH NAME
get_seg_limit \- Obtain the limit of a segment descriptor
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "unsigned long" get_seg_limit
.BI "(struct pt_regs *regs "  ","
.BI "int seg_reg_idx "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "regs" 12
Register values as seen when entering kernel mode
.IP "seg_reg_idx" 12
Index of the segment register pointing to seg descriptor
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Obtain the limit of the segment as indicated by the segment descriptor
pointed by the segment selector. The segment selector is obtained from the
input segment register index \fIseg_reg_idx\fP.

In protected mode, the limit of the segment descriptor in bytes.
In long mode and virtual-8086 mode, segment limits are not enforced. Thus,
limit is returned as -1L to imply a limit-less segment.

Zero is returned on error.
