Main driver structure
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Over Current Protection (OCP) will signal to the client driver
that an over-current event has happened and then will schedule
a recovery worker.

Disabling and eventually re-enabling the regulator is expected
to be done by the driver, as some hardware may be triggering an
over-current condition only at first initialization or it may
be expected only for a very brief amount of time, after which
the attached hardware may be expected to stabilize its current
draw.
.SH "RETURN"
IRQ_HANDLED for success or IRQ_NONE for failure.
