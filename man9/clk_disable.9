.SH NAME
clk_disable \- gate a clock
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" clk_disable
.BI "(struct clk *clk "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "clk" 12
the clk being gated
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
clk_disable must not sleep, which differentiates it from clk_unprepare.  In
a simple case, clk_disable can be used instead of clk_unprepare to gate a
clk if the operation is fast and will never sleep.  One example is a
SoC-internal clk which is controlled via simple register writes.  In the
complex case a clk gate operation may require a fast and a slow part.  It is
this reason that clk_unprepare and clk_disable are not mutually exclusive.
In fact clk_disable must be called before clk_unprepare.
