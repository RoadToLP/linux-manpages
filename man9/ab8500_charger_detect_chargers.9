.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Returns the type of charger connected.
For USB it will not mean we can actually charge from it
but that there is a USB cable connected that we have to
identify. This is used during startup when we don't get
interrupts of the charger detection

Returns an integer value, that means,
NO_PW_CONN  no power supply is connected
AC_PW_CONN  if the AC power supply is connected
USB_PW_CONN  if the USB power supply is connected
AC_PW_CONN + USB_PW_CONN if USB and AC power supplies are both connected
