.SH "DESCRIPTION"
TODO: Currently this routine is not compatible with recovery process
specified for idt_gen3 RapidIO switch devices. It has to be reviewed
to implement universal recovery process that is compatible full range
off available devices.
IDT gen3 switch driver now implements HW-specific error handler that
issues soft port reset to the port to reset ERR_STOP bits and ackIDs.
