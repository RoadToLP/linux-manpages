.SH NAME
s3c24xx_spi_tryfiq \- attempt to claim and setup FIQ for transfer
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" s3c24xx_spi_tryfiq
.BI "(struct s3c24xx_spi *hw "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "hw" 12
The hardware state.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Claim the FIQ handler (only one can be active at any one time) and
then setup the correct transfer code for this transfer.

This call updates all the necessary state information if successful,
so the caller does not need to do anything more than start the transfer
as normal, since the IRQ will have been re-routed to the FIQ handler.
