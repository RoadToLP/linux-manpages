.SH NAME
get_eff_addr_reg \- Obtain effective address from register operand
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" get_eff_addr_reg
.BI "(struct insn *insn "  ","
.BI "struct pt_regs *regs "  ","
.BI "int *regoff "  ","
.BI "long *eff_addr "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "insn" 12
Instruction. Must be valid.
.IP "regs" 12
Register values as seen when entering kernel mode
.IP "regoff" 12
Obtained operand offset, in pt_regs, with the effective address
.IP "eff_addr" 12
Obtained effective address
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Obtain the effective address stored in the register operand as indicated by
the ModRM byte. This function is to be used only with register addressing
(i.e.,  ModRM.mod is 3). The effective address is saved in \fIeff_addr\fP. The
register operand, as an offset from the base of pt_regs, is saved in \fIregoff\fP;
such offset can then be used to resolve the segment associated with the
operand. This function can be used with any of the supported address sizes
in x86.

0 on success. \fIeff_addr\fP will have the effective address stored in the
operand indicated by ModRM. \fIregoff\fP will have such operand as an offset from
the base of pt_regs.

-EINVAL on error.
