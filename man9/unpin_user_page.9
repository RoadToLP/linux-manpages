.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Pages that were pinned via pin_user_pages*() must be released via either
\fBunpin_user_page\fP, or one of the unpin_user_pages*() routines. This is so
that such pages can be separately tracked and uniquely handled. In
particular, interactions with RDMA and filesystems need special handling.
