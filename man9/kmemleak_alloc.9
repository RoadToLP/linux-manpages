.SH NAME
kmemleak_alloc \- register a newly allocated object
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void __ref" kmemleak_alloc
.BI "(const void *ptr "  ","
.BI "size_t size "  ","
.BI "int min_count "  ","
.BI "gfp_t gfp "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "ptr" 12
pointer to beginning of the object
.IP "size" 12
size of the object
.IP "min_count" 12
minimum number of references to this object. If during memory
scanning a number of references less than \fImin_count\fP is found,
the object is reported as a memory leak. If \fImin_count\fP is 0,
the object is never reported as a leak. If \fImin_count\fP is -1,
the object is ignored (not scanned and not reported as a leak)
.IP "gfp" 12
\fBkmalloc\fP flags used for kmemleak internal memory allocations
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function is called from the kernel allocators when a new object
(memory block) is allocated (kmem_cache_alloc, kmalloc etc.).
