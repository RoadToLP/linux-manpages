pci_reset_function \- quiesce and reset a PCI device function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" pci_reset_function
.BI "(struct pci_dev *dev "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dev" 12
PCI device to reset
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Some devices allow an individual function to be reset without affecting
other functions in the same device.  The PCI device must be responsive
to PCI config space in order to use this function.

This function does not just reset the PCI portion of a device, but
clears all the state associated with the device.  This function differs
from \fB__pci_reset_function_locked\fP in that it saves and restores device state
over the reset and takes the PCI device lock.

Returns 0 if the device function was successfully reset or negative if the
device doesn't support resetting a single function.
