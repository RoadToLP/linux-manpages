framebuffer to remove
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Cleanup framebuffer. This function is intended to be used from the drivers
\fIdrm_framebuffer_funcs.destroy\fP callback. It can also be used to clean up
driver private framebuffers embedded into a larger structure.

Note that this function does not remove the fb from active usage - if it is
still used anywhere, hilarity can ensue since userspace could call getfb on
the id and get back -EINVAL. Obviously no concern at driver unload time.

Also, the framebuffer will not be removed from the lookup idr - for
user-created framebuffers this will happen in in the rmfb ioctl. For
driver-private objects (e.g. for fbdev) drivers need to explicitly call
drm_framebuffer_unregister_private.
