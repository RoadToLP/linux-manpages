.SH NAME
clkdm_hwmod_enable \- add an enabled downstream hwmod to this clkdm
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" clkdm_hwmod_enable
.BI "(struct clockdomain *clkdm "  ","
.BI "struct omap_hwmod *oh "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "clkdm" 12
struct clockdomain *
.IP "oh" 12
struct omap_hwmod * of the enabled downstream hwmod
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Increment the usecount of the clockdomain \fIclkdm\fP and ensure that it
is awake before \fIoh\fP is enabled. Intended to be called by
\fBmodule_enable\fP code.
If the clockdomain is in software-supervised idle mode, force the
clockdomain to wake.  If the clockdomain is in hardware-supervised idle
mode, add clkdm-pwrdm autodependencies, to ensure that devices in the
clockdomain can be read from/written to by on-chip processors.
Returns -EINVAL if passed null pointers;
returns 0 upon success or if the clockdomain is in hwsup idle mode.
