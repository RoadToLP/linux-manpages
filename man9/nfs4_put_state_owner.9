.SH ARGUMENTS

state owner data to release
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Note that we keep released state owners on an LRU
list.
This caches valid state owners so that they can be
reused, to avoid the OPEN_CONFIRM on minor version 0.
It also pins the uniquifier of dropped state owners for
a while, to ensure that those state owner names are
never reused.
