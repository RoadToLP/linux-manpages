Read the Clause 45 defined base (7.19) and 10G (7.33) status registers,
filling in the link partner advertisement, pause and asym_pause members
in \fIphydev\fP.  This assumes that the auto-negotiation MMD is present, and
the backplane bit (7.48.0) is clear.  Clause 45 PHY drivers are expected
to fill in the remainder of the link partner advert from vendor registers.
