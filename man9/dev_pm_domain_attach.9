.SH NAME
dev_pm_domain_attach \- Attach a device to its PM domain.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" dev_pm_domain_attach
.BI "(struct device *dev "  ","
.BI "bool power_on "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dev" 12
Device to attach.
.IP "power_on" 12
Used to indicate whether we should power on the device.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The \fIdev\fP may only be attached to a single PM domain. By iterating through
the available alternatives we try to find a valid PM domain for the device.
As attachment succeeds, the ->\fBdetach\fP callback in the struct dev_pm_domain
should be assigned by the corresponding attach function.

This function should typically be invoked from subsystem level code during
the probe phase. Especially for those that holds devices which requires
power management through PM domains.

Callers must ensure proper synchronization of this function with power
management callbacks.

Returns 0 on successfully attached PM domain, or when it is found that the
device doesn't need a PM domain, else a negative error code.
