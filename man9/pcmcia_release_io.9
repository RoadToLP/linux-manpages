.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBpcmcia_release_io\fP releases the I/O ranges allocated by a PCMCIA
device.  This may be invoked some time after a card ejection has
already dumped the actual socket configuration, so if the client is
"stale", we don't bother checking the port ranges against the
current socket values.
