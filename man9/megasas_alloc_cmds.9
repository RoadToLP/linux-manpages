.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Each command that is issued to the FW, whether IO commands from the OS or
internal commands like IOCTLs, are wrapped in local data structure called
megasas_cmd. The frame embedded in this megasas_cmd is actually issued to
the FW.

Each frame has a 32-bit field called context (tag). This context is used
to get back the megasas_cmd from the frame when a frame gets completed in
the ISR. Typically the address of the megasas_cmd itself would be used as
the context. But we wanted to keep the differences between 32 and 64 bit
systems to the mininum. We always use 32 bit integers for the context. In
this driver, the 32 bit values are the indices into an array cmd_list.
This array is used only to look up the megasas_cmd given the context. The
free commands themselves are maintained in a linked list called cmd_pool.
