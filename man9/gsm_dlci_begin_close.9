DLCI to open

Commence closing a DLCI from the Linux side. We issue DISC messages
to the modem which should then reply with a UA, at which point we
will move into closed state. Closing is done asynchronously with retry
off timers. We may also receive a DM reply from the other end which
indicates the channel was already closed.
