.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Configure the IP block represented by \fIoh\fP.  This may include
enabling the IP block, resetting it, and placing it into a
post-setup state, depending on the type of IP block and applicable
flags.  IP blocks are reset to prevent any previous configuration
by the bootloader or previous operating system from interfering
with power management or other parts of the system.  The reset can
be avoided; see \fBomap_hwmod_no_setup_reset\fP.  This is the second of
two phases for hwmod initialization.  Code called here generally
affects the IP block hardware, or system integration hardware
associated with the IP block.  Returns 0.
