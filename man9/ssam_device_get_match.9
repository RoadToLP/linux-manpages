.SH NAME
ssam_device_get_match \- Find and return the ID matching the device in the ID table of the bound driver.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "const struct ssam_device_id *" ssam_device_get_match
.BI "(const struct ssam_device *dev "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dev" 12
The device for which to get the matching ID table entry.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Find the fist match for the UID of the device in the ID table of the
currently bound driver and return it. Returns NULL if the device does not
have a driver bound to it, the driver does not have match_table (i.e. it is
NULL), or there is no match in the driver's match_table.

This function essentially calls \fBssam_device_id_match\fP with the ID table of
the bound device driver and the UID of the device.
.SH "RETURN"
Returns the first match for the UID of the device in the device
driver's match table, or NULL if no such match could be found.
