.BI "int rpmflags "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dev" 12
Device to suspend.
.IP "rpmflags" 12
Flag bits.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
If the RPM_GET_PUT flag is set, decrement the device's usage count and
return immediately if it is larger than zero.  Then carry out a suspend,
either synchronous or asynchronous.

This routine may be called in atomic context if the RPM_ASYNC flag is set,
or if \fBpm_runtime_irq_safe\fP has been called.
