.SH NAME
minimum_image_size \- Estimate the minimum acceptable size of an image.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "unsigned long" minimum_image_size
.BI "(unsigned long saveable "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "saveable" 12
Number of saveable pages in the system.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
We want to avoid attempting to free too much memory too hard, so estimate the
minimum acceptable size of a hibernation image to use as the lower limit for
preallocating memory.

We assume that the minimum image size should be proportional to

[number of saveable pages] - [number of pages that can be freed in theory]

where the second term is the sum of (1) reclaimable slab pages, (2) active
and (3) inactive anonymous pages, (4) active and (5) inactive file pages.
