.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Get a label for the given pin.  This function works for both input and
output pins.  When \fIcfg\fP is given as non-NULL, the function tries to get
an optimized label using \fBhda_get_autocfg_input_label\fP.

This function tries to give a unique label string for the pin as much as
possible.  For example, when the multiple line-outs are present, it adds
the channel suffix like "Front", "Surround", etc (only when \fIcfg\fP is given).
If no unique name with a suffix is available and \fIindexp\fP is non-NULL, the
index number is stored in the pointer.
