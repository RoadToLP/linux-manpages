.SH NAME
ima_file_mprotect \- based on policy, limit mprotect change
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" ima_file_mprotect
.BI "(struct vm_area_struct *vma "  ","
.BI "unsigned long prot "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "vma" 12
-- undescribed --
.IP "prot" 12
contains the protection that will be applied by the kernel.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Files can be mmap'ed read/write and later changed to execute to circumvent
IMA's mmap appraisal policy rules.  Due to locking issues (mmap semaphore
would be taken before i_mutex), files can not be measured or appraised at
this point.  Eliminate this integrity gap by denying the mprotect
PROT_EXECUTE change, if an mmap appraise policy rule exists.

On mprotect change success, return 0.  On failure, return -EACESS.
