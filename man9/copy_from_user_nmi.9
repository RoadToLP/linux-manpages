.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Contrary to other \fBcopy_from_user\fP variants this function can be called
from NMI context. Despite the name it is not restricted to be called
from NMI context. It is safe to be called from any other context as
well. It disables pagefaults across the copy which means a fault will
abort the copy.

For NMI context invocations this relies on the nested NMI work to allow
atomic faults from the NMI path; the nested NMI paths are careful to
preserve CR2.
