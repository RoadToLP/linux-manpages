.SH NAME
ima_alloc_pages \- Allocate contiguous pages.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void *" ima_alloc_pages
.BI "(loff_t max_size "  ","
.BI "size_t *allocated_size "  ","
.BI "int last_warn "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "max_size" 12
Maximum amount of memory to allocate.
.IP "allocated_size" 12
Returned size of actual allocation.
.IP "last_warn" 12
Should the min_size allocation warn or not.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Tries to do opportunistic allocation for memory first trying to allocate
max_size amount of memory and then splitting that until zero order is
reached. Allocation is tried without generating allocation warnings unless
last_warn is set. Last_warn set affects only last allocation of zero order.

By default, ima_maxorder is 0 and it is equivalent to kmalloc(GFP_KERNEL)

Return pointer to allocated memory, or NULL on failure.
