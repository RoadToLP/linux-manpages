rproc_del \- unregister a remote processor
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" rproc_del
.BI "(struct rproc *rproc "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "rproc" 12
rproc handle to unregister
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function should be called when the platform specific rproc
implementation decides to remove the rproc device. it should
_only_ be called if a previous invocation of \fBrproc_add\fP
has completed successfully.

After \fBrproc_del\fP returns, \fIrproc\fP isn't freed yet, because
of the outstanding reference created by rproc_alloc. To decrement that
one last refcount, one still needs to call \fBrproc_free\fP.

Returns 0 on success and -EINVAL if \fIrproc\fP isn't valid.
