.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Setup handling of the SMBus alert protocol on a given I2C bus segment.

Handling can be done either through our IRQ handler, or by the
adapter (from its handler, periodic polling, or whatever).

This returns the ara client, which should be saved for later use with
\fBi2c_handle_smbus_alert\fP and ultimately \fBi2c_unregister_device\fP; or an
ERRPTR to indicate an error.
