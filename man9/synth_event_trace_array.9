.SH NAME
synth_event_trace_array \- Trace a synthetic event from an array
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" synth_event_trace_array
.BI "(struct trace_event_file *file "  ","
.BI "u64 *vals "  ","
.BI "unsigned int n_vals "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "file" 12
The trace_event_file representing the synthetic event
.IP "vals" 12
Array of values
.IP "n_vals" 12
The number of values in vals
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Trace a synthetic event using the values passed in as 'vals'.

The 'vals' array is just an array of 'n_vals' u64.  The number of
vals must match the number of field in the synthetic event, and
must be in the same order as the synthetic event fields.

All vals should be cast to u64, and string vals are just pointers
to strings, cast to u64.  Strings will be copied into space
reserved in the event for the string, using these pointers.
.SH "RETURN"
0 on success, err otherwise.
