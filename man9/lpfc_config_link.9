.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The configure link mailbox command is used before the initialize link
mailbox command to override default value and to configure link-oriented
parameters such as DID address and various timers. Typically, this
command would be used after an F_Port login to set the returned DID address
and the fabric timeout values. This command is not valid before a configure
port command has configured the HBA port.

This routine prepares the mailbox command for configuring link on a HBA.
