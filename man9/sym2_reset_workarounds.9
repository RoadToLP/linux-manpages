sym2_reset_workarounds \- hardware-specific work-arounds
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" sym2_reset_workarounds
.BI "(struct pci_dev *pdev "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "pdev" 12
pointer to PCI device
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This routine is similar to \fBsym_set_workarounds\fP, except
that, at this point, we already know that the device was
successfully initialized at least once before, and so most
of the steps taken there are un-needed here.
