.SH NAME
omap3_noncore_dpll_set_rate_and_parent \- set rate and parent for a DPLL clock
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" omap3_noncore_dpll_set_rate_and_parent
.BI "(struct clk_hw *hw "  ","
.BI "unsigned long rate "  ","
.BI "unsigned long parent_rate "  ","
.BI "u8 index "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "hw" 12
pointer to the clock to set rate and parent for
.IP "rate" 12
target rate for the DPLL
.IP "parent_rate" 12
clock rate of the DPLL parent
.IP "index" 12
new parent index for the DPLL, 0 - reference, 1 - bypass
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Sets rate and parent for a DPLL clock. If new parent is the bypass
clock, only selects the parent. Otherwise proceeds with a rate
change, as this will effectively also change the parent as the
DPLL is put into locked mode. Returns 0 with success, negative error
value otherwise.
