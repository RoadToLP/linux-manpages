.SH NAME
spi_mem_dirmap_read \- Read data through a direct mapping
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "ssize_t" spi_mem_dirmap_read
.BI "(struct spi_mem_dirmap_desc *desc "  ","
.BI "u64 offs "  ","
.BI "size_t len "  ","
.BI "void *buf "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "desc" 12
direct mapping descriptor
.IP "offs" 12
offset to start reading from. Note that this is not an absolute
offset, but the offset within the direct mapping which already has
its own offset
.IP "len" 12
length in bytes
.IP "buf" 12
destination buffer. This buffer must be DMA-able
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function reads data from a memory device using a direct mapping
previously instantiated with \fBspi_mem_dirmap_create\fP.
.SH "RETURN"
the amount of data read from the memory device or a negative error
code. Note that the returned size might be smaller than \fIlen\fP, and the caller
is responsible for calling \fBspi_mem_dirmap_read\fP again when that happens.
