iavf_map_rings_to_vectors \- Maps descriptor rings to vectors
.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "adapter" 12
board private structure to initialize
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function maps descriptor rings to the queue-specific vectors
we were allotted through the MSI-X enabling code.  Ideally, we'd have
one vector per ring/queue, but on a constrained vector budget, we
group the rings as "efficiently" as possible.  You would add new
mapping configurations in here.
