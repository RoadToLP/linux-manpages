.SH NAME
swap_bits_in_byte \- mirror the bits in a byte
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "u8" swap_bits_in_byte
.BI "(u8 b "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "b" 12
the byte to be mirrored
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The bits are swapped the following way:
Byte b include bits 0-7, nibble 1 (n1) include bits 0-3 and
nibble 2 (n2) bits 4-7.

Nibble 1 (n1):
(The "old" (moved) bit is replaced with a zero)
1. Move bit 6 and 7, 4 positions to the left.
2. Move bit 3 and 5, 2 positions to the left.
3. Move bit 1-4, 1 position to the left.

Nibble 2 (n2):
1. Move bit 0 and 1, 4 positions to the right.
2. Move bit 2 and 4, 2 positions to the right.
3. Move bit 3-6, 1 position to the right.

Combine the two nibbles to a complete and swapped byte.
