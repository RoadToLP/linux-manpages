.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Do the actual initialization sequence on the chip.  This is done
both from the init routine called from the PCI infrastructure, and
when we reset the chip, or detect that it was reset internally,
or it's administratively re-enabled.

Memory allocation here and in called routines is only done in
the first case (reinit == 0).  We have to be careful, because even
without memory allocation, we need to re-write all the chip registers
TIDs, etc. after the reset or enable has completed.
