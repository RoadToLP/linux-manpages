.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "indio_dev" 12
IIO device structure
.IP "h" 12
Function which will be used as pollfunc top half
.IP "thread" 12
Function which will be used as pollfunc bottom half
.IP "setup_ops" 12
Buffer setup functions to use for this device.
If NULL the default setup functions for triggered
buffers will be used.
.IP "buffer_attrs" 12
Extra sysfs buffer attributes for this IIO buffer
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function combines some common tasks which will normally be performed
when setting up a triggered buffer. It will allocate the buffer and the
pollfunc.

Before calling this function the indio_dev structure should already be
completely initialized, but not yet registered. In practice this means that
this function should be called right before \fBiio_device_register\fP.

To free the resources allocated by this function call
\fBiio_triggered_buffer_cleanup\fP.
