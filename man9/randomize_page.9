.SH NAME
randomize_page \- Generate a random, page aligned address
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "unsigned long" randomize_page
.BI "(unsigned long start "  ","
.BI "unsigned long range "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "start" 12
The smallest acceptable address the caller will take.
.IP "range" 12
The size of the area, starting at \fIstart\fP, within which the
random address must fall.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
If \fIstart\fP + \fIrange\fP would overflow, \fIrange\fP is capped.
.SH "NOTE"
Historical use of randomize_range, which this replaces, presumed that
\fIstart\fP was already page aligned.  We now align it regardless.
.SH "RETURN"
A page aligned address within [start, start + range).  On error,
\fIstart\fP is returned.
