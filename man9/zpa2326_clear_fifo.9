.SH NAME
zpa2326_clear_fifo \- Clear remaining entries in hardware FIFO.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" zpa2326_clear_fifo
.BI "(const struct iio_dev *indio_dev "  ","
.BI "unsigned int min_count "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "indio_dev" 12
The IIO device associated with the sampling hardware.
.IP "min_count" 12
Number of samples present within hardware FIFO.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fImin_count\fP argument is a hint corresponding to the known minimum number of
samples currently living in the FIFO. This allows to reduce the number of bus
accesses by skipping status register read operation as long as we know for
sure there are still entries left.
.SH "RETURN"
Zero when successful, a negative error code otherwise.
