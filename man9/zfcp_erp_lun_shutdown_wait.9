.SH NAME
zfcp_erp_lun_shutdown_wait \- Shutdown LUN and wait for erp completion
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" zfcp_erp_lun_shutdown_wait
.BI "(struct scsi_device *sdev "  ","
.BI "char *dbftag "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "sdev" 12
SCSI device / LUN to shut down.
.IP "dbftag" 12
Tag for debug trace event.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Do not acquire a reference for the LUN when creating the ERP
action. It is safe, because this function waits for the ERP to
complete first. This allows to shutdown the LUN, even when the SCSI
device is in the state SDEV_DEL when scsi_device_get will fail.
