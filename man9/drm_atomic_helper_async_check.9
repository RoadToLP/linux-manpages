.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This helper will check if it is possible to commit the state asynchronously.
Async commits are not supposed to swap the states like normal sync commits
but just do in-place changes on the current state.

It will return 0 if the commit can happen in an asynchronous fashion or error
if not. Note that error just mean it can't be commited asynchronously, if it
fails the commit should be treated like a normal synchronous commit.
