.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dst" 12
RGB565 destination buffer (iomem)
.IP "dst_pitch" 12
destination buffer pitch
.IP "vaddr" 12
XRGB8888 source buffer
.IP "fb" 12

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Drivers can use this function for RGB888 devices that don't natively
support XRGB8888.

This function applies clipping on dst, i.e. the destination is a
full (iomem) framebuffer but only the clip rect content is copied over.
