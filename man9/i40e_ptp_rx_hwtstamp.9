i40e_ptp_rx_hwtstamp \- Utility function which checks for an Rx timestamp
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" i40e_ptp_rx_hwtstamp
.BI "(struct i40e_pf *pf "  ","
.BI "struct sk_buff *skb "  ","

.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "pf" 12
Board private structure
.IP "skb" 12
Particular skb to send timestamp with
.IP "index" 12
Index into the receive timestamp registers for the timestamp
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The XL710 receives a notification in the receive descriptor with an offset
into the set of RXTIME registers where the timestamp is for that skb. This
function goes and fetches the receive timestamp from that offset, if a valid
one exists. The RXTIME registers are in ns, so we must convert the result
first.
