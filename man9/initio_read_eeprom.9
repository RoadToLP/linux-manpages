Base of InitIO Host Adapter

Retrieve the host adapter configuration data from E2Prom. If the
data is invalid then the defaults are used and are also restored
into the E2PROM. This forms the access point for the SCSI driver
into the E2PROM layer, the other functions for the E2PROM are all
internal use.

Must be called single threaded, uses a shared global area.
