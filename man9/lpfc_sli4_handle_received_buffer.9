.SH NAME
lpfc_sli4_handle_received_buffer \- Handle received buffers from firmware
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" lpfc_sli4_handle_received_buffer
.BI "(struct lpfc_hba *phba "  ","
.BI "struct hbq_dmabuf *dmabuf "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "phba" 12
Pointer to HBA context object.
.IP "dmabuf" 12
Pointer to a dmabuf that describes the FC sequence.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function is called with no lock held. This function processes all
the received buffers and gives it to upper layers when a received buffer
indicates that it is the final frame in the sequence. The interrupt
service routine processes received buffers at interrupt contexts.
Worker thread calls lpfc_sli4_handle_received_buffer, which will call the
appropriate receive function when the final frame in a sequence is received.
