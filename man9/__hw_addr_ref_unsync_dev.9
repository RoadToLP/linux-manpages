.SH NAME
__hw_addr_ref_unsync_dev \- Remove synchronized addresses and references on it from device
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" __hw_addr_ref_unsync_dev
.BI "(struct netdev_hw_addr_list *list "  ","
.BI "struct net_device *dev "  ","
.BI "int (*unsync)(struct net_device *, const unsigned char *, int) "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "list" 12
address list to remove synchronized addresses (references on it) from
.IP "dev" 12
device to sync
.IP "unsync" 12
function to call if address and references on it should be removed

Remove all addresses that were added to the device by
\fB__hw_addr_ref_sync_dev\fP. This function is intended to be called from the
ndo_stop or ndo_open functions on devices that require explicit address (or
references on it) add/remove notifications. If the unsync function pointer
is NULL then this function can be used to just reset the sync_cnt for the
addresses in the list.
