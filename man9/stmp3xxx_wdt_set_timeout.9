.SH NAME
stmp3xxx_wdt_set_timeout \- configure the watchdog inside the STMP3xxx RTC
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" stmp3xxx_wdt_set_timeout
.BI "(struct device *dev "  ","
.BI "u32 timeout "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dev" 12
the parent device of the watchdog (= the RTC)
.IP "timeout" 12
the desired value for the timeout register of the watchdog.
0 disables the watchdog
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The watchdog needs one register and two bits which are in the RTC domain.
To handle the resource conflict, the RTC driver will create another
platform_device for the watchdog driver as a child of the RTC device.
The watchdog driver is passed the below accessor function via platform_data
to configure the watchdog. Locking is not needed because accessing SET/CLR
registers is atomic.
