.SH NAME
lpfc_cmpl_els_flogi_fabric \- Completion function for flogi to a fabric port
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" lpfc_cmpl_els_flogi_fabric
.BI "(struct lpfc_vport *vport "  ","
.BI "struct lpfc_nodelist *ndlp "  ","
.BI "struct serv_parm *sp "  ","
.BI "IOCB_t *irsp "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "vport" 12
pointer to a host virtual N_Port data structure.
.IP "ndlp" 12
pointer to a node-list data structure.
.IP "sp" 12
pointer to service parameter data structure.
.IP "irsp" 12
pointer to the IOCB within the lpfc response IOCB.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This routine is invoked by the \fBlpfc_cmpl_els_flogi\fP completion callback
function to handle the completion of a Fabric Login (FLOGI) into a fabric
port in a fabric topology. It properly sets up the parameters to the \fIndlp\fP
from the IOCB response. It also check the newly assigned N_Port ID to the
\fIvport\fP against the previously assigned N_Port ID. If it is different from
the previously assigned Destination ID (DID), the \fBlpfc_unreg_rpi\fP routine
is invoked on all the remaining nodes with the \fIvport\fP to unregister the
Remote Port Indicators (RPIs). Finally, the \fBlpfc_issue_fabric_reglogin\fP
is invoked to register login to the fabric.

Return code
0 - Success (currently, always return 0)
