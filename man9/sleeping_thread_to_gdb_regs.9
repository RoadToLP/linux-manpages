.SH NAME
sleeping_thread_to_gdb_regs \- Convert ptrace regs to GDB regs
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" sleeping_thread_to_gdb_regs
.BI "(unsigned long *gdb_regs "  ","
.BI "struct task_struct *p "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gdb_regs" 12
A pointer to hold the registers in the order GDB wants.
.IP "p" 12
The \fIstruct task_struct\fP of the desired process.

Convert the register values of the sleeping process in \fIp\fP to
the format that GDB expects.
This function is called when kgdb does not have access to the
\fIstruct pt_regs\fP and therefore it should fill the gdb registers
\fIgdb_regs\fP with what has been saved in \fIstruct thread_struct\fP
thread field during switch_to.
