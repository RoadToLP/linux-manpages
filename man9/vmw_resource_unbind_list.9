.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" vmw_resource_unbind_list
.BI "(struct vmw_buffer_object *vbo "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "vbo" 12
Pointer to the current backing MOB.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Evicts the Guest Backed hardware resource if the backup
buffer is being moved out of MOB memory.

validation code, since resource validation and eviction
both require the backup buffer to be reserved.
