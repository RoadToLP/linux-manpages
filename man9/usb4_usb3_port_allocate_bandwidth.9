.SH NAME
usb4_usb3_port_allocate_bandwidth \- Allocate bandwidth for USB3
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" usb4_usb3_port_allocate_bandwidth
.BI "(struct tb_port *port "  ","
.BI "int *upstream_bw "  ","
.BI "int *downstream_bw "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "port" 12
USB3 adapter port
.IP "upstream_bw" 12
New upstream bandwidth
.IP "downstream_bw" 12
New downstream bandwidth
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This can be used to set how much bandwidth is allocated for the USB3
tunneled isochronous traffic. \fIupstream_bw\fP and \fIdownstream_bw\fP are the
new values programmed to the USB3 adapter allocation registers. If
the values are lower than what is currently consumed the allocation
is set to what is currently consumed instead (consumed bandwidth
cannot be taken away by CM). The actual new values are returned in
\fIupstream_bw\fP and \fIdownstream_bw\fP.

Returns 0 in case of success and negative errno if there was a
failure.
