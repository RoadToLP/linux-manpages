.SH NAME
san_client_link \- Link client as consumer to SAN device.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" san_client_link
.BI "(struct device *client "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "client" 12
The client to link.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Sets up a device link between the provided client device as consumer and
the SAN device as provider. This function can be used to ensure that the
SAN interface has been set up and will be set up for as long as the driver
of the client device is bound. This guarantees that, during that time, all
dGPU events will be received by any registered notifier.

The link will be automatically removed once the client device's driver is
unbound.
.SH "RETURN"
Returns zero on success, -ENXIO if the SAN interface has not been
set up yet, and -ENOMEM if device link creation failed.
