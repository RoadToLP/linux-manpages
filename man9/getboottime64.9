.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" getboottime64

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Returns the wall-time of boot in a timespec64.

This is based on the wall_to_monotonic offset and the total suspend
time. Calls to settimeofday will affect the value returned (which
basically means that however wrong your real time clock is at boot time,
you get the right time here).
