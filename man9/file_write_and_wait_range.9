.SH NAME
file_write_and_wait_range \- write out & wait on a file range
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" file_write_and_wait_range
.BI "(struct file *file "  ","
.BI "loff_t lstart "  ","
.BI "loff_t lend "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "file" 12
file pointing to address_space with pages
.IP "lstart" 12
offset in bytes where the range starts
.IP "lend" 12
offset in bytes where the range ends (inclusive)
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Write out and wait upon file offsets lstart->lend, inclusive.

Note that \fIlend\fP is inclusive (describes the last byte to be written) so
that this function can be used to write to the very end-of-file (end = -1).

After writing out and waiting on the data, we check and advance the
f_wb_err cursor to the latest value, and return any errors detected there.
.SH "RETURN"
0 on success, negative error code otherwise.
