.SH NAME
drm_gem_mmap \- memory map routine for GEM objects
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" drm_gem_mmap
.BI "(struct file *filp "  ","
.BI "struct vm_area_struct *vma "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "filp" 12
DRM file pointer
.IP "vma" 12
VMA for the area to be mapped
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
If a driver supports GEM object mapping, mmap calls on the DRM file
descriptor will end up here.

Look up the GEM object based on the offset passed in (vma->vm_pgoff will
contain the fake offset we created when the GTT map ioctl was called on
the object) and map it with a call to \fBdrm_gem_mmap_obj\fP.

If the caller is not granted access to the buffer object, the mmap will fail
with EACCES. Please see the vma manager for more information.
