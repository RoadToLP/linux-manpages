.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "map" 12
The tracing_map

.IP "sort_entries" 12
outval: pointer to allocated and sorted array of entries
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBtracing_map_sort_entries\fP sorts the current set of entries in the
map and returns the list of tracing_map_sort_entries containing
them to the client in the sort_entries param.  The client can
access the struct tracing_map_elt element of interest directly as
the 'elt' field of a returned struct tracing_map_sort_entry object.

The sort_key has only two fields: idx and descending.  'idx' refers
to the index of the field added via \fBtracing_map_add_sum_field\fP or
\fBtracing_map_add_key_field\fP when the tracing_map was initialized.
'descending' is a flag that if set reverses the sort order, which
by default is ascending.

The client should not hold on to the returned array but should use
it and call \fBtracing_map_destroy_sort_entries\fP when done.
.SH "RETURN"
the number of sort_entries in the struct tracing_map_sort_entry
array, negative on error
