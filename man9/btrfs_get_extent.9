.SH NAME
btrfs_get_extent \- Lookup the first extent overlapping a range in a file.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "struct extent_map *" btrfs_get_extent
.BI "(struct btrfs_inode *inode "  ","
.BI "struct page *page "  ","
.BI "size_t pg_offset "  ","
.BI "u64 start "  ","
.BI "u64 len "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "inode" 12
file to search in
.IP "page" 12
page to read extent data into if the extent is inline
.IP "pg_offset" 12
offset into \fIpage\fP to copy to
.IP "start" 12
file offset
.IP "len" 12
length of range starting at \fIstart\fP
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This returns the first \fIstruct extent_map\fP which overlaps with the given
range, reading it from the B-tree and caching it if necessary. Note that
there may be more extents which overlap the given range after the returned
extent_map.

If \fIpage\fP is not NULL and the extent is inline, this also reads the extent
data directly into the page and marks the extent up to date in the io_tree.
.SH "RETURN"
ERR_PTR on error, non-NULL extent_map on success.
