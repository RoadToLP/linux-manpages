.SH NAME
dsa_lag_map \- Map LAG netdev to a linear LAG ID
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" dsa_lag_map
.BI "(struct dsa_switch_tree *dst "  ","
.BI "struct net_device *lag "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dst" 12
Tree in which to record the mapping.
.IP "lag" 12
Netdev that is to be mapped to an ID.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
dsa_lag_id/dsa_lag_dev can then be used to translate between the
two spaces. The size of the mapping space is determined by the
driver by setting ds->num_lag_ids. It is perfectly legal to leave
it unset if it is not needed, in which case these functions become
no-ops.
