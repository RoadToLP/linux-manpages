.SH NAME
superhyway_add_device \- Add a SuperHyway module
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" superhyway_add_device
.BI "(unsigned long base "  ","
.BI "struct superhyway_device *sdev "  ","
.BI "struct superhyway_bus *bus "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "base" 12
Physical address where module is mapped.
.IP "sdev" 12
SuperHyway device to add, or NULL to allocate a new one.
.IP "bus" 12
Bus where SuperHyway module resides.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This is responsible for adding a new SuperHyway module. This sets up a new
struct superhyway_device for the module being added if \fIsdev\fP == NULL.

Devices are initially added in the order that they are scanned (from the
top-down of the memory map), and are assigned an ID based on the order that
they are added. Any manual addition of a module will thus get the ID after
the devices already discovered regardless of where it resides in memory.

Further work can and should be done in \fBsuperhyway_scan_bus\fP, to be sure
that any new modules are properly discovered and subsequently registered.
