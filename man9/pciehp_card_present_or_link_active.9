.SH NAME
pciehp_card_present_or_link_active \- whether given slot is occupied
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" pciehp_card_present_or_link_active
.BI "(struct controller *ctrl "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "ctrl" 12
PCIe hotplug controller
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Unlike \fBpciehp_card_present\fP, which determines presence solely from the
Presence Detect State bit, this helper also returns true if the Link Active
bit is set.  This is a concession to broken hotplug ports which hardwire
Presence Detect State to zero, such as Wilocity's [1ae9:0200].
.SH "RETURN"
1 if the slot is occupied and 0 if it is not. If the hotplug
port is not present anymore returns -ENODEV.
