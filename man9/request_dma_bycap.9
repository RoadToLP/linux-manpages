.BI "(const char **dmac "  ","
.BI "const char **caps "  ","
.BI "const char *dev_id "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS

List of DMA controllers to search
.IP "caps" 12
List of capabilities
.IP "dev_id" 12

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Search all channels of all DMA controllers to find a channel which
matches the requested capabilities. The result is the channel
number if a match is found, or -ENODEV if no match is found.

Note that not all DMA controllers export capabilities, in which
case they can never be allocated using this API, and so
\fBrequest_dma\fP must be used specifying the channel number.
