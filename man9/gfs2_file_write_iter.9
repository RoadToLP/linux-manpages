.BI "struct iov_iter *from "  ");"

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
We have to do a lock/unlock here to refresh the inode size for
O_APPEND writes, otherwise we can land up writing at the wrong
offset. There is still a race, but provided the app is using its
own file locking, this will make O_APPEND work as expected.
