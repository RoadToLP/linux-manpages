.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function is used by LPT garbage collection.  LPT garbage collection is
used only for the "big" LPT model (c->big_lpt == 1).  Garbage collection
simply involves marking all the nodes in the LEB being garbage-collected as
dirty.  The dirty nodes are written next commit, after which the LEB is free
to be reused.

This function returns 0 on success and a negative error code on failure.
