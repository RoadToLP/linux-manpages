.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "bus" 12
PCI bus on which desired PCI device resides
.IP "devfn" 12
encodes number of PCI slot in which the desired PCI
device resides and the logical device number within that slot
in case of multi-function devices.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Given a PCI bus and slot/function number, the desired PCI device
is located in the list of PCI devices.
If the device is found, its reference count is increased and this
function returns a pointer to its data structure.  The caller must
decrement the reference count by calling \fBpci_dev_put\fP.
If no device is found, NULL is returned.
