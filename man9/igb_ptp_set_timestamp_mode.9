.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Outgoing time stamping can be enabled and disabled. Play nice and
disable it when requested, although it shouldn't case any overhead
when no packet needs it. At most one packet in the queue may be
marked for time stamping, otherwise it would be impossible to tell
for sure to which packet the hardware time stamp belongs.

Incoming time stamping has to be configured via the hardware
filters. Not all combinations are supported, in particular event
type has to be specified. Matching the kind of event packet is
not supported, with the exception of "all V2 events regardless of
level 2 or 4".
