Return 'true' on success or 'false' on error.

If $UsnJrnl is not present or in the process of being disabled, we set
\fBNVolUsnJrnlStamped\fP and return success.

If the $UsnJrnl $DATA/$J attribute has a size equal to the lowest valid usn,
i.e. transaction logging has only just been enabled or the journal has been
stamped and nothing has been logged since, we also set \fBNVolUsnJrnlStamped\fP
and return success.
