Verifies that the EEPROM has completed the update.  After updating the
EEPROM, we need to check bit 15 in work 0x23 for the checksum fix.  If
the checksum fix is not implemented, we need to set the bit and update
the checksum.  Otherwise, if bit 15 is set and the checksum is incorrect,
we need to return bad checksum.
