struct powerdomain * to read mem powerstate for
.IP "bank" 12
memory bank index
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Reads the previous memory powerstate for a powerdomain. This
function must determine the previous memory powerstate by first
checking the previous powerstate for the domain. If that was OFF,
then logic has been lost. If previous state was RETENTION, the
function reads the setting for the next memory retention state to
see the actual value.  In every other case, the logic is
retained. Returns either PWRDM_POWER_OFF or PWRDM_POWER_RET
depending whether logic was retained or not.
