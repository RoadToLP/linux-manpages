__lpfc_sli4_hba_process_cq \- Process a fast-path event queue entry
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" __lpfc_sli4_hba_process_cq
.BI "(struct lpfc_queue *cq "  ","
.BI "enum lpfc_poll_mode poll_mode "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "cq" 12
Pointer to CQ to be processed
.IP "poll_mode" 12
Enum lpfc_poll_state to determine poll mode
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This routine calls the cq processing routine with the handler for
fast path CQEs.

The CQ routine returns two values: the first is the calling status,
which indicates whether work was queued to the  background discovery
thread. If true, the routine should wakeup the discovery thread;
the second is the delay parameter. If non-zero, rather than rearming
the CQ and yet another interrupt, the CQ handler should be queued so
that it is processed in a subsequent polling action. The value of
the delay indicates when to reschedule it.
