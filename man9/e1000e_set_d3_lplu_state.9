.BI "(struct e1000_hw *hw "  ","
.BI "bool active "  ");"

.IP "active" 12
boolean used to enable/disable lplu

The low power link up (lplu) state is set to the power management level D3
and SmartSpeed is disabled when active is true, else clear lplu for D3
and enable Smartspeed.  LPLU and Smartspeed are mutually exclusive.  LPLU
is used during Dx states where the power conservation is most important.
During driver activity, SmartSpeed should be enabled so performance is
maintained.
