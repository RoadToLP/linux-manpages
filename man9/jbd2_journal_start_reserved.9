.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Start handle that has been previously reserved with \fBjbd2_journal_reserve\fP.
This attaches \fIhandle\fP to the running transaction (or creates one if there's
not transaction running). Unlike \fBjbd2_journal_start\fP this function cannot
block on journal commit, checkpointing, or similar stuff. It can block on
memory allocation or frozen journal though.

Return 0 on success, non-zero on error - handle is freed in that case.
