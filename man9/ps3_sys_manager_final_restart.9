.SH "DESCRIPTION"

This routine never returns.  The routine disables asynchronous vuart reads
then spins calling \fBps3_sys_manager_handle_msg\fP to receive and acknowledge
the shutdown command sent from the system manager.  Soon after the
acknowledgement is sent the lpar is destroyed by the HV.  This routine
should only be called from \fBps3_restart\fP through ps3_sys_manager_ops.restart.
