.SH NAME
of_mdio_find_bus \- Given an mii_bus node, find the mii_bus.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "struct mii_bus *" of_mdio_find_bus
.BI "(struct device_node *mdio_bus_np "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "mdio_bus_np" 12
Pointer to the mii_bus.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Returns a reference to the mii_bus, or NULL if none found.  The
embedded struct device will have its reference count incremented,
and this must be put once the bus is finished with.

Because the association of a device_node and mii_bus is made via
\fBof_mdiobus_register\fP, the mii_bus cannot be found before it is
registered with \fBof_mdiobus_register\fP.
