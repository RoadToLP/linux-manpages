.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "drv" 12
sst_data
.IP "gv" 12
the stored value of gain (also contains rampduration)

.IP "loc_id" 12
location/position index
.IP "module_id" 12
module index
.IP "mute" 12
flag that indicates whether this was called from the

digital_mute callback, module will be muted/unmuted based on this
flag. The flag is always 0 if called directly.
