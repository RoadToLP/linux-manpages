<output>

Update buffer configuration based on pfc configuration and
priority to buffer mapping.
Buffer's lossy bit is changed to:
lossless if there is at least one PFC enabled priority
mapped to this buffer lossy if all priorities mapped to
this buffer are PFC disabled
.SH "RETURN"
0 if no error,
sets change to true if buffer configuration was modified.
