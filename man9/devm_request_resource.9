.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This is a device-managed version of \fBrequest_resource\fP. There is usually
no need to release resources requested by this function explicitly since
that will be taken care of when the device is unbound from its driver.
If for some reason the resource needs to be released explicitly, because
of ordering issues for example, drivers must call \fBdevm_release_resource\fP
rather than the regular \fBrelease_resource\fP.

When a conflict is detected between any existing resources and the newly
requested resource, an error message will be printed.

Returns 0 on success or a negative error code on failure.
