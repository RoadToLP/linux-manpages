.SH "DESCRIPTION"
A transmitter error has happened. Most likely excess collisions (which
is a fairly normal condition). If the error is one where the Tx will
have been aborted, we try and send another one right away, instead of
letting the failed packet sit and collect dust in the Tx buffer. This
is a much better solution as it avoids kernel based Tx timeouts, and
an unnecessary card reset.

Called with lock held.
