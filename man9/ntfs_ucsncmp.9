.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Compare the first \fIn\fP characters of the Unicode strings \fIs1\fP and \fIs2\fP,
The strings in little endian format and appropriate \fBle16_to_cpu\fP
conversion is performed on non-little endian machines.

The function returns an integer less than, equal to, or greater than zero
if \fIs1\fP (or the first \fIn\fP Unicode characters thereof) is found, respectively,
to be less than, to match, or be greater than \fIs2\fP.
