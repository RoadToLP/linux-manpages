.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This is the actual HBA-timer timeout handler to be invoked by the worker
thread whenever the HBA timer fired and HBA-timeout event posted. This
handler performs any periodic operations needed for the device. If such
periodic event has already been attended to either in the interrupt handler
or by processing slow-ring or fast-ring events within the HBA-timer
timeout window (LPFC_HB_MBOX_INTERVAL), this handler just simply resets
the timer for the next timeout period. If lpfc heart-beat mailbox command
is configured and there is no heart-beat mailbox command outstanding, a
heart-beat mailbox is issued and timer set properly. Otherwise, if there
has been a heart-beat mailbox command outstanding, the HBA shall be put
to offline.
