.SH NAME
alloc_iova \- allocates an iova
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "struct iova *" alloc_iova
.BI "(struct iova_domain *iovad "  ","
.BI "unsigned long size "  ","
.BI "unsigned long limit_pfn "  ","
.BI "bool size_aligned "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "iovad" 12
- iova domain in question
.IP "size" 12
- size of page frames to allocate
.IP "limit_pfn" 12
- max limit address
.IP "size_aligned" 12
- set if size_aligned address range is required
This function allocates an iova in the range iovad->start_pfn to limit_pfn,
searching top-down from limit_pfn to iovad->start_pfn. If the size_aligned
flag is set then the allocated address iova->pfn_lo will be naturally
aligned on roundup_power_of_two(size).
