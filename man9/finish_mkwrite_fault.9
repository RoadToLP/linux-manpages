.SH NAME
finish_mkwrite_fault \- finish page fault for a shared mapping, making PTE writeable once the page is prepared
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "vm_fault_t" finish_mkwrite_fault
.BI "(struct vm_fault *vmf "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "vmf" 12
structure describing the fault
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function handles all that is needed to finish a write page fault in a
shared mapping due to PTE being read-only once the mapped page is prepared.
It handles locking of PTE and modifying it.

The function expects the page to be locked or other protection against
concurrent faults / writeback (such as DAX radix tree locks).
.SH "RETURN"
VM_FAULT_WRITE on success, 0 when PTE got changed before
we acquired PTE lock.
