.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Named triggers are sets of triggers that share a common set of
trigger data.  The first named trigger registered with a given name
owns the common trigger data that the others subsequently
registered with the same name will reference.  This function
associates the common trigger data from the first trigger with the
given trigger.
