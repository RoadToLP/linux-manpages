.SH NAME
ti_bandgap_tshut_init \- setup and initialize tshut handling
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" ti_bandgap_tshut_init
.BI "(struct ti_bandgap *bgp "  ","
.BI "struct platform_device *pdev "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "bgp" 12
pointer to struct ti_bandgap
.IP "pdev" 12
pointer to device struct platform_device
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Call this function only in case the bandgap features HAS(TSHUT).
In this case, the driver needs to handle the TSHUT signal as an IRQ.
The IRQ is wired as a GPIO, and for this purpose, it is required
to specify which GPIO line is used. TSHUT IRQ is fired anytime
one of the bandgap sensors violates the TSHUT high/hot threshold.
And in that case, the system must go off.
.SH "RETURN"
0 if no error, else error status
