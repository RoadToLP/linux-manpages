.SH NAME
drm_gem_handle_create_tail \- internal functions to create a handle
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" drm_gem_handle_create_tail
.BI "(struct drm_file *file_priv "  ","
.BI "struct drm_gem_object *obj "  ","
.BI "u32 *handlep "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "file_priv" 12
drm file-private structure to register the handle for
.IP "obj" 12
object to register
.IP "handlep" 12
pointer to return the created handle to the caller
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This expects the \fIdrm_device.object_name_lock\fP to be held already and will
drop it before returning. Used to avoid races in establishing new handles
when importing an object from either an flink name or a dma-buf.

Handles must be release again through \fBdrm_gem_handle_delete\fP. This is done
when userspace closes \fIfile_priv\fP for all attached handles, or through the
GEM_CLOSE ioctl for individual handles.
