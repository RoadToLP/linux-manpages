.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "r" 12
the resource manager
.IP "max_payload_bytes" 12
the amount of data (including CIP headers) per packet
.IP "speed" 12
the speed (e.g., SCODE_400) at which the packets will be sent
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function allocates one isochronous channel and enough bandwidth for the
specified packet size.

Returns the channel number that the caller must use for streaming, or
a negative error code.  Due to potentionally long delays, this function is
interruptible and can return -ERESTARTSYS.  On success, the caller is
responsible for calling \fBfw_iso_resources_update\fP on bus resets, and
\fBfw_iso_resources_free\fP when the resources are not longer needed.
