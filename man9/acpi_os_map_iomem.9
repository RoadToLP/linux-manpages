.SH NAME
acpi_os_map_iomem \- Get a virtual address for a given physical address range.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void __iomem __ref *" acpi_os_map_iomem
.BI "(acpi_physical_address phys "  ","
.BI "acpi_size size "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "phys" 12
Start of the physical address range to map.
.IP "size" 12
Size of the physical address range to map.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Look up the given physical address range in the list of existing ACPI memory
mappings.  If found, get a reference to it and return a pointer to it (its
virtual address).  If not found, map it, add it to that list and return a
pointer to it.

During early init (when acpi_permanent_mmap has not been set yet) this
routine simply calls \fB__acpi_map_table\fP to get the job done.
