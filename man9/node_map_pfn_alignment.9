node_map_pfn_alignment \- determine the maximum internode alignment
.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH "DESCRIPTION"

This function should be called after node map is populated and sorted.
It calculates the maximum power of two alignment which can distinguish
all the nodes.

For example, if all nodes are 1GiB and aligned to 1GiB, the return value
would indicate 1GiB alignment with (1 << (30 - PAGE_SHIFT)).  If the
nodes are shifted by 256MiB, 256MiB.  Note that if only the last node is
shifted, 1GiB is enough and this function will indicate so.

This is used to test whether pfn -> nid mapping of the chosen memory
model has fine enough granularity to avoid incorrect mapping for the
populated node map.
.SH "RETURN"
the determined alignment in pfn's.  0 if there is no alignment
requirement (single node).
