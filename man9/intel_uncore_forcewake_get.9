intel_uncore_forcewake_get \- grab forcewake domain references
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" intel_uncore_forcewake_get
.BI "(struct intel_uncore *uncore "  ","
.BI "enum forcewake_domains fw_domains "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "uncore" 12
the intel_uncore structure
.IP "fw_domains" 12
forcewake domains to get reference on
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function can be used get GT's forcewake domain references.
Normal register access will handle the forcewake domains automatically.
However if some sequence requires the GT to not power down a particular
forcewake domains this function should be called at the beginning of the
sequence. And subsequently the reference should be dropped by symmetric
call to \fBintel_unforce_forcewake_put\fP. Usually caller wants all the domains
to be kept awake so the \fIfw_domains\fP would be then FORCEWAKE_ALL.
