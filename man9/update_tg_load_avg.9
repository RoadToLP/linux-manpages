.SH NAME
update_tg_load_avg \- update the tg's load avg
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" update_tg_load_avg
.BI "(struct cfs_rq *cfs_rq "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "cfs_rq" 12
the cfs_rq whose avg changed
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function 'ensures': tg->load_avg := \Sum tg->cfs_rq[]->avg.load.
However, because tg->load_avg is a global value there are performance
considerations.

In order to avoid having to look at the other cfs_rq's, we use a
differential update where we store the last value we propagated. This in
turn allows skipping updates if the differential is 'small'.

Updating tg's load_avg is necessary before \fBupdate_cfs_share\fP.
