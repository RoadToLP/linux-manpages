.SH NAME
get_note_number_and_size_elf64 \- get the number of PT_NOTE program headers and sum of real size of their ELF note segment headers and data.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" get_note_number_and_size_elf64
.BI "(const Elf64_Ehdr *ehdr_ptr "  ","
.BI "int *nr_ptnote "  ","
.BI "u64 *sz_ptnote "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "ehdr_ptr" 12
ELF header
.IP "nr_ptnote" 12
buffer for the number of PT_NOTE program headers
.IP "sz_ptnote" 12
buffer for size of unique PT_NOTE program header
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function is used to merge multiple PT_NOTE program headers
into a unique single one. The resulting unique entry will have
\fIsz_ptnote\fP in its phdr->p_mem.

It is assumed that program headers with PT_NOTE type pointed to by
\fIehdr_ptr\fP has already been updated by update_note_header_size_elf64
and each of PT_NOTE program headers has actual ELF note segment
size in its p_memsz member.
