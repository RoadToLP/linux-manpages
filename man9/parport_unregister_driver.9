structure describing the driver that was given to
\fBparport_register_driver\fP

This should be called by a parallel port device driver that
has registered itself using \fBparport_register_driver\fP when it
is about to be unloaded.

When it returns, the driver's \fBattach\fP routine will no longer
be called, and for each port that \fBattach\fP was called for, the
\fBdetach\fP routine will have been called.

All the driver's \fBattach\fP and \fBdetach\fP calls are guaranteed to have
finished by the time this function returns.
