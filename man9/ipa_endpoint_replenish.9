.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The IPA hardware can hold a fixed number of receive buffers for an RX
endpoint, based on the number of entries in the underlying channel ring
buffer.  If an endpoint's "backlog" is non-zero, it indicates how many
more receive buffers can be supplied to the hardware.  Replenishing for
an endpoint can be disabled, in which case requests to replenish a
buffer are "saved", and transferred to the backlog once it is re-enabled
again.
