.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH ARGUMENTS

device to open
.IP "extack" 12
netlink extended ack

Takes a device from down to up state. The device's private open
function is invoked and then the multicast lists are loaded. Finally
the device is moved into the up state and a NETDEV_UP message is
sent to the netdev notifier chain.

Calling this function on an active interface is a nop. On a failure
a negative errno code is returned.
