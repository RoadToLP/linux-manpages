.SH SYNOPSIS

.BI "(struct ib_cq *cq "  ","
.BI "struct ib_wc *wc "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "cq" 12
Completion queue.
.IP "wc" 12
Work completion.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
XXX: what is now target_execute_cmd used to be asynchronous, and unmapping
the data that has been transferred via IB RDMA had to be postponed until the
\fBcheck_stop_free\fP callback.  None of this is necessary anymore and needs to
be cleaned up.
