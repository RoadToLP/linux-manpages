.SH NAME
pci_p2pdma_distance_many \- Determine the cumulative distance between a p2pdma provider and the clients in use.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" pci_p2pdma_distance_many
.BI "(struct pci_dev *provider "  ","
.BI "struct device **clients "  ","
.BI "int num_clients "  ","
.BI "bool verbose "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "provider" 12
p2pdma provider to check against the client list
.IP "clients" 12
array of devices to check (NULL-terminated)
.IP "num_clients" 12
number of clients in the array
.IP "verbose" 12
if true, print warnings for devices when we return -1
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Returns -1 if any of the clients are not compatible, otherwise returns a
positive number where a lower number is the preferable choice. (If there's
one client that's the same as the provider it will return 0, which is best
choice).

"compatible" means the provider and the clients are either all behind
the same PCI root port or the host bridges connected to each of the devices
are listed in the 'pci_p2pdma_whitelist'.
