The HVC thread calls this method to read characters from the back-end.
If an IUCV communication path has been established, pending IUCV messages
are received and data is copied into buffer \fIbuf\fP up to \fIcount\fP bytes.

Locking:     The routine gets called under an \fBirqsave\fP spinlock; and
the routine locks the struct hvc_iucv_private->lock to call
helper functions.
