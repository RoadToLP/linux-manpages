.SH NAME
clk_set_parent \- switch the parent of a mux clk
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" clk_set_parent
.BI "(struct clk *clk "  ","
.BI "struct clk *parent "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "clk" 12
the mux clk whose input we are switching
.IP "parent" 12
the new input to clk
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Re-parent clk to use parent as its new input source.  If clk is in
prepared state, the clk will get enabled for the duration of this call. If
that's not acceptable for a specific clk (Eg: the consumer can't handle
that, the reparenting is glitchy in hardware, etc), use the
CLK_SET_PARENT_GATE flag to allow reparenting only when clk is unprepared.

After successfully changing clk's parent clk_set_parent will update the
clk topology, sysfs topology and propagate rate recalculation via
__clk_recalc_rates.

Returns 0 on success, -EERROR otherwise.
