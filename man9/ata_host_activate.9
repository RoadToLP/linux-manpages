.BI "(struct ata_host *host "  ","

.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "host" 12
target ATA host
.IP "irq" 12
IRQ to request
.IP "irq_handler" 12
irq_handler used when requesting IRQ
.IP "irq_flags" 12
irq_flags used when requesting IRQ
.IP "sht" 12
scsi_host_template to use when registering the host

After allocating an ATA host and initializing it, most libata
LLDs perform three steps to activate the host - start host,
request IRQ and register it.  This helper takes necessary
arguments and performs the three steps in one go.

An invalid IRQ skips the IRQ registration and expects the host to
have set polling mode on the port. In this case, \fIirq_handler\fP
should be NULL.

LOCKING:
Inherited from calling layer (may sleep).
.SH "RETURN"
0 on success, -errno otherwise.
