.SH NAME
drm_atomic_helper_fake_vblank \- fake VBLANK events if needed
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" drm_atomic_helper_fake_vblank
.BI "(struct drm_atomic_state *old_state "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "old_state" 12
atomic state object with old state structures
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function walks all CRTCs and fakes VBLANK events on those with
\fIdrm_crtc_state.no_vblank\fP set to true and \fIdrm_crtc_state.event\fP != NULL.
The primary use of this function is writeback connectors working in oneshot
mode and faking VBLANK events. In this case they only fake the VBLANK event
when a job is queued, and any change to the pipeline that does not touch the
connector is leading to timeouts when calling
\fBdrm_atomic_helper_wait_for_vblanks\fP or
\fBdrm_atomic_helper_wait_for_flip_done\fP. In addition to writeback
connectors, this function can also fake VBLANK events for CRTCs without
VBLANK interrupt.

This is part of the atomic helper support for nonblocking commits, see
\fBdrm_atomic_helper_setup_commit\fP for an overview.
