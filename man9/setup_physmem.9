setup_physmem \- Setup physical memory for UML
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" setup_physmem
.BI "(unsigned long start "  ","
.BI "unsigned long reserve_end "  ","
.BI "unsigned long len "  ","
.BI "unsigned long long highmem "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "start" 12
Start address of the physical kernel memory,
i.e start address of the executable image.
.IP "reserve_end" 12
end address of the physical kernel memory.
.IP "len" 12
Length of total physical memory that should be mapped/made
available, in bytes.
.IP "highmem" 12
Number of highmem bytes that should be mapped/made available.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Creates an unlinked temporary file of size (len + highmem) and memory maps
it on the last executable image address (uml_reserved).

The offset is needed as the length of the total physical memory
(len + highmem) includes the size of the memory used be the executable image,
but the mapped-to address is the last address of the executable image
(uml_reserved == end address of executable image).

The memory mapped memory of the temporary file is used as backing memory
of all user space processes/kernel tasks.
