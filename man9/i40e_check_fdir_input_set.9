.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Ensures that a given ethtool_rx_flow_spec has a valid mask. Some support
for partial matches exists with a few limitations. First, hardware only
supports masking by word boundary (2 bytes) and not per individual bit.
Second, hardware is limited to using one mask for a flow type and cannot
use a separate mask for each filter.

To support these limitations, if we already have a configured filter for
the specified type, this function enforces that new filters of the type
match the configured input set. Otherwise, if we do not have a filter of
the specified type, we allow the input set to be updated to match the
desired filter.

To help ensure that administrators understand why filters weren't displayed
as supported, we print a diagnostic message displaying how the input set
would change and warning to delete the preexisting filters if required.

Returns 0 on successful input set match, and a negative return code on
failure.
