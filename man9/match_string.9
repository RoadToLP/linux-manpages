.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This routine will look for a string in an array of strings up to the
n-th element in the array or until the first NULL element.

Historically the value of -1 for \fIn\fP, was used to search in arrays that
are NULL terminated. However, the function does not make a distinction
when finishing the search: either \fIn\fP elements have been compared OR
the first NULL element was found.
.SH "RETURN"
index of a \fIstring\fP in the \fIarray\fP if matches, or -EINVAL otherwise.
