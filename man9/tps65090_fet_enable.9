.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Some versions of the tps65090 have issues when turning on the FETs.
This function goes through several steps to ensure the best chance of the
FET going on.  Specifically:
- We'll make sure that we bump the "overcurrent wait" to the maximum, which
increases the chances that we'll turn on properly.
- We'll retry turning the FET on multiple times (turning off in between).
.SH "RETURN"
0 if ok, non-zero if it fails.
