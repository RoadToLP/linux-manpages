.SH "DESCRIPTION"
blkgs should be removed while holding both q and blkcg locks.  As blkcg lock
is nested inside q lock, this function performs reverse double lock dancing.
Destroying the blkgs releases the reference held on the blkcg's css allowing
blkcg_css_free to eventually be called.

This is the blkcg counterpart of \fBioc_release_fn\fP.
