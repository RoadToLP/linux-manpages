.SH NAME
drm_atomic_normalize_zpos \- calculate normalized zpos values for all crtcs
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" drm_atomic_normalize_zpos
.BI "(struct drm_device *dev "  ","
.BI "struct drm_atomic_state *state "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dev" 12
DRM device
.IP "state" 12
atomic state of DRM device
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function calculates normalized zpos value for all modified planes in
the provided atomic state of DRM device.

For every CRTC this function checks new states of all planes assigned to
it and calculates normalized zpos value for these planes. Planes are compared
first by their zpos values, then by plane id (if zpos is equal). The plane
with lowest zpos value is at the bottom. The \fIdrm_plane_state.normalized_zpos\fP
is then filled with unique values from 0 to number of active planes in crtc
minus one.

RETURNS
Zero for success or -errno
