.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Start at the end of the kmsg buffer and fill the provided buffer
with as many of the *youngest* kmsg records that fit into it.
If the buffer is large enough, all available kmsg records will be
copied with a single call.

Consecutive calls will fill the buffer with the next block of
available older records, not including the earlier retrieved ones.

A return value of FALSE indicates that there are no more records to
read.
