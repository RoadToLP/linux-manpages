.SH NAME
serial_install \- install tty
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" serial_install
.BI "(struct tty_driver *driver "  ","
.BI "struct tty_struct *tty "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "driver" 12
the driver (USB in our case)
.IP "tty" 12
the tty being created
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Initialise the termios structure for this tty.  We use the default
USB serial settings but permit them to be overridden by
serial->type->init_termios on first open.

This is the first place a new tty gets used.  Hence this is where we
acquire references to the usb_serial structure and the driver module,
where we store a pointer to the port, and where we do an autoresume.
All these actions are reversed in \fBserial_cleanup\fP.
