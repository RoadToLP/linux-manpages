.SH NAME
ucb1x00_io_set_dir \- set IO direction
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" ucb1x00_io_set_dir
.BI "(struct ucb1x00 *ucb "  ","
.BI "unsigned int in "  ","
.BI "unsigned int out "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "ucb" 12
UCB1x00 structure describing chip
.IP "in" 12
bitfield of IO pins to be set as inputs
.IP "out" 12
bitfield of IO pins to be set as outputs

Set the IO direction of the ten general purpose IO pins on
the UCB1x00 chip.  The \fIin\fP bitfield has priority over the
\fIout\fP bitfield, in that if you specify a pin as both input
and output, it will end up as an input.

ucb1x00_enable must have been called to enable the comms
before using this function.

This function takes a spinlock, disabling interrupts.
