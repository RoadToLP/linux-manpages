.SH "DESCRIPTION"
We need to allow some glocks to be enqueued, dequeued, promoted, and demoted
when we're withdrawn. For example, to maintain metadata integrity, we should
disallow the use of inode and rgrp glocks when withdrawn. Other glocks, like
iopen or the transaction glocks may be safely used because none of their
metadata goes through the journal. So in general, we should disallow all
glocks that are journaled, and allow all the others. One exception is:
we need to allow our active journal to be promoted and demoted so others
may recover it and we can reacquire it when they're done.
