.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function is an ixgbe specific version of __pskb_pull_tail.  The
main difference between this version and the original function is that
this function can make several assumptions about the state of things
that allow for significant optimizations versus the standard function.
As a result we can do things like drop a frag and maintain an accurate
truesize for the skb.
