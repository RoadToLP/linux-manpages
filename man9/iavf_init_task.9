.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This task completes the work that was begun in probe. Due to the nature
of VF-PF communications, we may need to wait tens of milliseconds to get
responses back from the PF. Rather than busy-wait in probe and bog down the
whole system, we'll do it in a task so we can sleep.
This task only runs during driver init. Once we've established
communications with the PF driver and set up our netdev, the watchdog
takes over.
