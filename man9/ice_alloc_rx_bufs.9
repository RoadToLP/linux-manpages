.SH NAME
ice_alloc_rx_bufs \- Replace used receive buffers
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "bool" ice_alloc_rx_bufs
.BI "(struct ice_ring *rx_ring "  ","
.BI "u16 cleaned_count "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "rx_ring" 12
ring to place buffers on
.IP "cleaned_count" 12
number of buffers to replace
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Returns false if all allocations were successful, true if any fail. Returning
true signals to the caller that we didn't replace cleaned_count buffers and
there is more work to do.

First, try to clean "cleaned_count" Rx buffers. Then refill the cleaned Rx
buffers. Then bump tail at most one time. Grouping like this lets us avoid
multiple tail writes per call.
