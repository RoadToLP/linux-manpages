\fBmmc_is_req_done\fP is used with requests that have
mrq->cap_cmd_during_tfr = true. \fBmmc_is_req_done\fP must be called after
starting a request and before waiting for it to complete. That is,
either in between calls to \fBmmc_start_req\fP, or after \fBmmc_wait_for_req\fP
and before \fBmmc_wait_for_req_done\fP. If it is called at other times the
result is not meaningful.
