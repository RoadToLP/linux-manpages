.SH NAME
tracing_map_lookup \- Retrieve val from a tracing_map
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "struct tracing_map_elt *" tracing_map_lookup
.BI "(struct tracing_map *map "  ","
.BI "void *key "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "map" 12
The tracing_map to perform the lookup on
.IP "key" 12
The key to look up
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Looks up key in tracing_map and if found returns the matching
tracing_map_elt.  This is a lock-free lookup; see
\fBtracing_map_insert\fP for details on tracing_map and how it works.
Every time an element is retrieved, the 'hits' value is
incremented.  There is one user-visible tracing_map variable,
'hits', which is updated by this function.  Every time an element
is successfully retrieved, the 'hits' value is incremented.  The
'drops' value is never updated by this function.
.SH "RETURN"
the tracing_map_elt pointer val associated with the key.
If the key wasn't found, NULL is returned.
