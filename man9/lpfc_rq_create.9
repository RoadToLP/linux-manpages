.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "phba" 12
HBA structure that indicates port to create a queue on.
.IP "hrq" 12
The queue structure to use to create the header receive queue.
.IP "drq" 12
The queue structure to use to create the data receive queue.
.IP "cq" 12
The completion queue to bind this work queue to.
.IP "subtype" 12
The subtype of the work queue indicating its functionality.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function creates a receive buffer queue pair , as detailed in \fIhrq\fP and
\fIdrq\fP, on a port, described by \fIphba\fP by sending a RQ_CREATE mailbox command
to the HBA.

The \fIphba\fP struct is used to send mailbox command to HBA. The \fIdrq\fP and \fIhrq\fP
struct is used to get the entry count that is necessary to determine the
number of pages to use for this queue. The \fIcq\fP is used to indicate which
completion queue to bind received buffers that are posted to these queues to.
This function will send the RQ_CREATE mailbox command to the HBA to setup the
receive queue pair. This function is asynchronous and will wait for the
mailbox command to finish before continuing.

On success this function will return a zero. If unable to allocate enough
memory this function will return -ENOMEM. If the queue create mailbox command
fails this function will return -ENXIO.
