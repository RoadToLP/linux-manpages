.SH NAME
device_links_unbind_consumers \- Force unbind consumers of the given device.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" device_links_unbind_consumers
.BI "(struct device *dev "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dev" 12
Device to unbind the consumers of.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Walk the list of links to consumers for \fIdev\fP and if any of them is in the
"consumer probe" state, wait for all device probes in progress to complete
and start over.

If that's not the case, change the status of the link to "supplier unbind"
and check if the link was in the "active" state.  If so, force the consumer
driver to unbind and start over (the consumer will not re-probe as we have
changed the state of the link already).

Links without the DL_FLAG_MANAGED flag set are ignored.
