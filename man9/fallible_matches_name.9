.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This is a "fallible" version of '\fBmatches_name\fP' function which does not
panic if the direntry/xentry referred by \fIzbr\fP does not exist on the media.

This function checks if xentry/direntry referred by zbranch \fIzbr\fP matches name
\fInm\fP. Returns NAME_MATCHES it does, NAME_LESS if the name referred by \fIzbr\fP
is less than \fInm\fP, NAME_GREATER if it is greater than \fInm\fP, and \fINOT_ON_MEDIA\fP
if xentry/direntry referred by \fIzbr\fP does not exist on the media. A negative
error code is returned in case of failure.
