.SH NAME
get_governor_trips \- get the number of the two trip points that are key for this governor
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" get_governor_trips
.BI "(struct thermal_zone_device *tz "  ","
.BI "struct power_allocator_params *params "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "tz" 12
thermal zone to operate on
.IP "params" 12
pointer to private data for this governor
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The power allocator governor works optimally with two trips points:
a "switch on" trip point and a "maximum desired temperature".  These
are defined as the first and last passive trip points.

If there is only one trip point, then that's considered to be the
"maximum desired temperature" trip point and the governor is always
on.  If there are no passive or active trip points, then the
governor won't do anything.  In fact, its throttle function
won't be called at all.
