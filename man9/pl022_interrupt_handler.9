.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function handles interrupts generated for an interrupt based transfer.
If a receive overrun (ROR) interrupt is there then we disable SSP, flag the
current message's state as STATE_ERROR and schedule the tasklet
pump_transfers which will do the postprocessing of the current message by
calling \fBgiveback\fP. Otherwise it reads data from RX FIFO till there is no
more data, and writes data in TX FIFO till it is not full. If we complete
the transfer we move to the next transfer and schedule the tasklet.
