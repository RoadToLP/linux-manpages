.SH NAME
prb_reserve \- Reserve space in the ringbuffer.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "bool" prb_reserve
.BI "(struct prb_reserved_entry *e "  ","
.BI "struct printk_ringbuffer *rb "  ","
.BI "struct printk_record *r "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "e" 12
The entry structure to setup.
.IP "rb" 12
The ringbuffer to reserve data in.
.IP "r" 12
The record structure to allocate buffers for.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This is the public function available to writers to reserve data.

The writer specifies the text size to reserve by setting the
\fItext_buf_size\fP field of \fIr\fP. To ensure proper initialization of \fIr\fP,
\fBprb_rec_init_wr\fP should be used.

On success, the fields \fIinfo\fP and \fItext_buf\fP of \fIr\fP will be set by this
function and should be filled in by the writer before committing. Also
on success, \fBprb_record_text_space\fP can be used on \fIe\fP to query the actual
space used for the text data block.

Important: \fIinfo->text_len\fP needs to be set correctly by the writer in
order for data to be readable and/or extended. Its value
is initialized to 0.
.SH "CONTEXT"
Any context. Disables local interrupts on success.
.SH "RETURN"
true if at least text data could be allocated, otherwise false.
