.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "fwnode" 12
handle of the firmware node
.IP "con_id" 12
function within the GPIO consumer
.IP "index" 12
index of the GPIO to obtain for the consumer
.IP "flags" 12
GPIO initialization flags
.IP "label" 12
label to attach to the requested GPIO
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function can be used for drivers that get their configuration
from opaque firmware.

The function properly finds the corresponding GPIO using whatever is the
underlying firmware interface and then makes sure that the GPIO
descriptor is requested before it is returned to the caller.

In case of error an \fBERR_PTR\fP is returned.
.SH "RETURN"
On successful request the GPIO pin is configured in accordance with
provided \fIflags\fP.
