PCI device

Distinguish Intel IDE-R controller devices from other Intel IDE
devices. IDE-R devices have no timing registers and are in
most respects virtual. They should be driven by the ata_generic
driver.

IDE-R devices have PCI offset 0xF8.L as zero, later Intel ATA has
it non zero. All Intel ATA has 0x40 writable (timing), but it is
not writable on IDE-R devices (this is guaranteed).
