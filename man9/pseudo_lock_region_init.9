pseudo-lock region
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Called after user provided a schemata to be pseudo-locked. From the
schemata the \fIstruct pseudo_lock_region\fP is on entry already initialized
with the resource, domain, and capacity bitmask. Here the information
required for pseudo-locking is deduced from this data and \fIstruct
pseudo_lock_region\fP initialized further. This information includes:
- size in bytes of the region to be pseudo-locked
- cache line size to know the stride with which data needs to be accessed
to be pseudo-locked
- a cpu associated with the cache instance on which the pseudo-locking
flow can be executed
.SH "RETURN"
0 on success, <0 on failure. Descriptive error will be written
to last_cmd_status buffer.
