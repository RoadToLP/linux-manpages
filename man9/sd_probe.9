.SH NAME
sd_probe \- called during driver initialization and whenever a new scsi device is attached to the system. It is called once for each scsi device (not just disks) present.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" sd_probe
.BI "(struct device *dev "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dev" 12
pointer to device object

Returns 0 if successful (or not interested in this scsi device 
(e.g. scanner)); 1 when there is an error.
.SH "NOTE"
this function is invoked from the scsi mid-level.
This function sets up the mapping between a given 
<host,channel,id,lun> (found in sdp) and new device name 
(e.g. /dev/sda). More precisely it is the block device major 
and minor number that is chosen here.

Assume sd_probe is not re-entrant (for time being)
Also think about \fBsd_probe\fP and \fBsd_remove\fP running coincidentally.
