ATA port to freeze

This function is called when HSM violation or some other
condition disrupts normal operation of the port.  Frozen port
is not allowed to perform any operation until the port is
thawed, which usually follows a successful reset.

ap->ops->\fBfreeze\fP callback can be used for freezing the port
hardware-wise (e.g. mask interrupt and stop DMA engine).  If a
port cannot be frozen hardware-wise, the interrupt handler
must ack and clear interrupts unconditionally while the port
is frozen.

LOCKING:
spin_lock_irqsave(host lock)
