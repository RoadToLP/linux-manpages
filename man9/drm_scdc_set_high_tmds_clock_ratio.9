.SH NAME
drm_scdc_set_high_tmds_clock_ratio \- set TMDS clock ratio
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "bool" drm_scdc_set_high_tmds_clock_ratio
.BI "(struct i2c_adapter *adapter "  ","
.BI "bool set "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "adapter" 12
I2C adapter for DDC channel
.IP "set" 12
ret or reset the high clock ratio


TMDS clock ratio calculations go like this:
TMDS character = 10 bit TMDS encoded value

TMDS character rate = The rate at which TMDS characters are
transmitted (Mcsc)

TMDS bit rate = 10x TMDS character rate

As per the spec:
TMDS clock rate for pixel clock < 340 MHz = 1x the character
rate = 1/10 pixel clock rate

TMDS clock rate for pixel clock > 340 MHz = 0.25x the character
rate = 1/40 pixel clock rate

Writes to the TMDS config register over SCDC channel, and:
sets TMDS clock ratio to 1/40 when set = 1

sets TMDS clock ratio to 1/10 when set = 0
.SH "RETURN"
True if write is successful, false otherwise.
