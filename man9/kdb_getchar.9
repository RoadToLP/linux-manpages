.SH NAME
kdb_getchar \- Read a single character from a kdb console (or consoles).
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "char" kdb_getchar
.BI "(void "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS

no arguments
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Other than polling the various consoles that are currently enabled,
most of the work done in this function is dealing with escape sequences.

An escape key could be the start of a vt100 control sequence such as \e[D
(left arrow) or it could be a character in its own right.  The standard
method for detecting the difference is to wait for 2 seconds to see if there
are any other characters.  kdb is complicated by the lack of a timer service
(interrupts are off), by multiple input sources. Escape sequence processing
has to be done as states in the polling loop.
.SH "RETURN"
The key pressed or a control code derived from an escape sequence.
