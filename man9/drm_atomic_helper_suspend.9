.SH NAME
drm_atomic_helper_suspend \- subsystem-level suspend helper
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "struct drm_atomic_state *" drm_atomic_helper_suspend
.BI "(struct drm_device *dev "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dev" 12
DRM device
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Duplicates the current atomic state, disables all active outputs and then
returns a pointer to the original atomic state to the caller. Drivers can
pass this pointer to the \fBdrm_atomic_helper_resume\fP helper upon resume to
restore the output configuration that was active at the time the system
entered suspend.

Note that it is potentially unsafe to use this. The atomic state object
returned by this function is assumed to be persistent. Drivers must ensure
that this holds true. Before calling this function, drivers must make sure
to suspend fbdev emulation so that nothing can be using the device.

.SH "RETURN"
A pointer to a copy of the state before suspend on success or an \fBERR_PTR\fP-
encoded error code on failure. Drivers should store the returned atomic
state object and pass it to the \fBdrm_atomic_helper_resume\fP helper upon
resume.
