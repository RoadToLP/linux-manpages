.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function automatically fills node magic number, assigns sequence
number, and calculates node CRC checksum. The length of the \fIbuf\fP buffer has
to be aligned to the minimal I/O unit size. This function automatically
appends padding node and padding bytes if needed. Returns zero in case of
success and a negative error code in case of failure.
