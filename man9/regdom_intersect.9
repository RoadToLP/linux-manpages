.SH NAME
regdom_intersect \- do the intersection between two regulatory domains
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "struct ieee80211_regdomain *" regdom_intersect
.BI "(const struct ieee80211_regdomain *rd1 "  ","
.BI "const struct ieee80211_regdomain *rd2 "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "rd1" 12
first regulatory domain
.IP "rd2" 12
second regulatory domain
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Use this function to get the intersection between two regulatory domains.
Once completed we will mark the alpha2 for the rd as intersected, "98",
as no one single alpha2 can represent this regulatory domain.

Returns a pointer to the regulatory domain structure which will hold the
resulting intersection of rules between rd1 and rd2. We will
\fBkzalloc\fP this structure for you.
