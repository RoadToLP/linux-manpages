.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Called at seq_file->op->\fBstart\fP. Call this function if you want to
print a header at the top of the output.

This list-traversal primitive may safely run concurrently with
the _rcu list-mutation primitives such as \fBhlist_add_head_rcu\fP
as long as the traversal is guarded by \fBrcu_read_lock\fP.
