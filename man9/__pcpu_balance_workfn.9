.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Reclaim all fully free chunks except for the first one.  This is also
responsible for maintaining the pool of empty populated pages.  However,
it is possible that this is called when physical memory is scarce causing
OOM killer to be triggered.  We should avoid doing so until an actual
allocation causes the failure as it is possible that requests can be
serviced from already backed regions.
