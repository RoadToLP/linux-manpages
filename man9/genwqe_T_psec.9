.SH "NOTE"
From a design perspective it turned out to be a bad idea to
use codes here to specifiy the frequency/speed values. An old
driver cannot understand new codes and is therefore always a
problem. Better is to measure out the value or put the
speed/frequency directly into a register which is always a valid
value for old as well as for new software.
