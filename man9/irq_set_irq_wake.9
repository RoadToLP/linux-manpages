.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" irq_set_irq_wake
.BI "(unsigned int irq "  ","
.BI "unsigned int on "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "irq" 12
interrupt to control
.IP "on" 12
enable/disable power management wakeup

Enable/disable power management wakeup mode, which is
disabled by default.  Enables and disables must match,
just as they match for non-wakeup mode support.

Wakeup mode lets this IRQ wake the system from sleep
states like "suspend to RAM".
.SH "NOTE"
irq enable/disable state is completely orthogonal
to the enable/disable state of irq wake. An irq can be
disabled with \fBdisable_irq\fP and still wake the system as
long as the irq has wake enabled. If this does not hold,
then the underlying irq chip and the related driver need
to be investigated.
