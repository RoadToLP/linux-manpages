.SH NAME
snd_pcm_hw_constraint_msbits \- add a hw constraint msbits rule
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" snd_pcm_hw_constraint_msbits
.BI "(struct snd_pcm_runtime *runtime "  ","
.BI "unsigned int cond "  ","
.BI "unsigned int width "  ","
.BI "unsigned int msbits "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "runtime" 12
PCM runtime instance
.IP "cond" 12
condition bits
.IP "width" 12
sample bits width
.IP "msbits" 12
msbits width
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This constraint will set the number of most significant bits (msbits) if a
sample format with the specified width has been select. If width is set to 0
the msbits will be set for any sample format with a width larger than the
specified msbits.
.SH "RETURN"
Zero if successful, or a negative error code on failure.
