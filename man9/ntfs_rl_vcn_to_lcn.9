ntfs_rl_vcn_to_lcn \- convert a vcn into a lcn given a runlist
.SH SYNOPSIS

.BI "(const runlist_element *rl "  ","
.BI "const VCN vcn "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "rl" 12

.IP "vcn" 12
vcn to convert
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Convert the virtual cluster number \fIvcn\fP of an attribute into a logical
cluster number (lcn) of a device using the runlist \fIrl\fP to map vcns to their
corresponding lcns.

It is up to the caller to serialize access to the runlist \fIrl\fP.

Since lcns must be >= 0, we use negative return codes with special meaning:

Return code          Meaning / Description
==================================================
LCN_HOLE            Hole / not allocated on disk.
LCN_RL_NOT_MAPPED   This is part of the runlist which has not been
inserted into the runlist yet.
LCN_ENOENT          There is no such vcn in the attribute.

Locking: - The caller must have locked the runlist (for reading or writing).
- This function does not touch the lock, nor does it modify the
runlist.
