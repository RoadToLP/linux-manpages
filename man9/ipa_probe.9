.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This is the main entry point for the IPA driver.  Initialization proceeds
in several stages:
- The "init" stage involves activities that can be initialized without
access to the IPA hardware.
- The "config" stage requires the IPA clock to be active so IPA registers
can be accessed, but does not require the use of IPA immediate commands.
- The "setup" stage uses IPA immediate commands, and so requires the GSI
layer to be initialized.

A Boolean Device Tree "modem-init" property determines whether GSI
initialization will be performed by the AP (Trust Zone) or the modem.
If the AP does GSI initialization, the setup phase is entered after
this has completed successfully.  Otherwise the modem initializes
the GSI layer and signals it has finished by sending an SMP2P interrupt
to the AP; this triggers the start if IPA setup.
