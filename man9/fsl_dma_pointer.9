.SH "DESCRIPTION"

This function is called by ALSA when ALSA wants to know where in the
stream buffer the hardware currently is.

For playback, the SAR register contains the physical address of the most
recent DMA transfer.  For capture, the value is in the DAR register.

The base address of the buffer is stored in the source_addr field of the
first link descriptor.
