.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "params" 12
the parameters struct to initialize
.IP "inode" 12
the inode for which the Merkle tree is being built
.IP "hash_algorithm" 12
number of hash algorithm to use
.IP "log_blocksize" 12
log base 2 of block size to use
.IP "salt" 12
pointer to salt (optional)
.IP "salt_size" 12
size of salt, possibly 0
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Validate the hash algorithm and block size, then compute the tree topology
(num levels, num blocks in each level, etc.) and initialize \fIparams\fP.
.SH "RETURN"
