tpm_try_get_ops \- Get a ref to the tpm_chip
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" tpm_try_get_ops
.BI "(struct tpm_chip *chip "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "chip" 12
Chip to ref
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The caller must already have some kind of locking to ensure that chip is
valid. This function will lock the chip so that the ops member can be
accessed safely. The locking prevents tpm_chip_unregister from
completing, so it should not be held for long periods.

Returns -ERRNO if the chip could not be got.
