.SH NAME
__clk_speculate_rates \- 
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" __clk_speculate_rates
.BI "(struct clk_core *core "  ","
.BI "unsigned long parent_rate "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "core" 12
first clk in the subtree
.IP "parent_rate" 12
the "future" rate of clk's parent
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Walks the subtree of clks starting with clk, speculating rates as it
goes and firing off PRE_RATE_CHANGE notifications as necessary.

Unlike clk_recalc_rates, clk_speculate_rates exists only for sending
pre-rate change notifications and returns early if no clks in the
subtree have subscribed to the notifications.  Note that if a clk does not
implement the .recalc_rate callback then it is assumed that the clock will
take on the rate of its parent.
