.SH NAME
sugov_iowait_boost \- Updates the IO boost status of a CPU.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" sugov_iowait_boost
.BI "(struct sugov_cpu *sg_cpu "  ","
.BI "u64 time "  ","
.BI "unsigned int flags "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "sg_cpu" 12
the sugov data for the CPU to boost
.IP "time" 12
the update time from the caller
.IP "flags" 12
SCHED_CPUFREQ_IOWAIT if the task is waking up after an IO wait
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Each time a task wakes up after an IO operation, the CPU utilization can be
boosted to a certain utilization which doubles at each "frequent and
successive" wakeup from IO, ranging from IOWAIT_BOOST_MIN to the utilization
of the maximum OPP.

To keep doubling, an IO boost has to be requested at least once per tick,
otherwise we restart from the utilization of the minimum OPP.
