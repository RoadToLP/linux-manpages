.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dev" 12
valid struct device pointer, or NULL for ISA and EISA-like devices
.IP "vma" 12
vm_area_struct describing requested user mapping
.IP "cpu_addr" 12
kernel CPU-view address returned from dma_alloc_attrs
.IP "dma_addr" 12
device-view address returned from dma_alloc_attrs
.IP "size" 12
size of memory originally requested in dma_alloc_attrs
.IP "attrs" 12
attributes of mapping properties requested in dma_alloc_attrs
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Map a coherent DMA buffer previously allocated by dma_alloc_attrs into user
space.  The coherent DMA buffer must not be freed by the driver until the
user space mapping has been released.
