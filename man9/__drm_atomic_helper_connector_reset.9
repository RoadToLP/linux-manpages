.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Initializes the newly allocated \fIconn_state\fP and assigns it to
the \fIdrm_connector->state\fP pointer of \fIconnector\fP, usually required when
initializing the drivers or when called from the \fIdrm_connector_funcs.reset\fP
hook.

This is useful for drivers that subclass the connector state.
