This sets the inactivity timeout for a particular device on a
port.  This affects functions like \fBparport_wait_peripheral\fP.
The special value 0 means not to call \fBschedule\fP while dealing
with this device.

The return value is the previous inactivity timeout.

Any callers of \fBparport_wait_event\fP for this device are woken
up.
