.SH NAME
comedi_set_hw_dev \- Set hardware device associated with COMEDI device
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" comedi_set_hw_dev
.BI "(struct comedi_device *dev "  ","
.BI "struct device *hw_dev "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dev" 12
COMEDI device.
.IP "hw_dev" 12
Hardware device.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
For automatically configured COMEDI devices (resulting from a call to
\fBcomedi_auto_config\fP or one of its wrappers from the low-level COMEDI
driver), \fBcomedi_set_hw_dev\fP is called automatically by the COMEDI core
to associate the COMEDI device with the hardware device.  It can also be
called directly by "legacy" low-level COMEDI drivers that rely on the
COMEDI_DEVCONFIG ioctl to configure the hardware as long as the hardware
has a \fIstruct device\fP.

If \fIdev->hw_dev\fP is NULL, it gets a reference to \fIhw_dev\fP and sets
\fIdev->hw_dev\fP, otherwise, it does nothing.  Calling it multiple times
with the same hardware device is not considered an error.  If it gets
a reference to the hardware device, it will be automatically 'put' when
the device is detached from COMEDI.

Returns 0 if \fIdev->hw_dev\fP was NULL or the same as \fIhw_dev\fP, otherwise
returns -EEXIST.
