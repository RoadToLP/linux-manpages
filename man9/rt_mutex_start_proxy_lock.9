Starts the rt_mutex acquire; it enqueues the \fIwaiter\fP and does deadlock
detection. It does not wait, see \fBrt_mutex_wait_proxy_lock\fP for that.

Special API call for PI-futex support.
.SH "NOTE"
unlike __rt_mutex_start_proxy_lock this _DOES_ remove the \fIwaiter\fP
on failure.
.SH "RETURN"
0 - task blocked on lock
1 - acquired the lock for task, caller should wake it up
<0 - error
