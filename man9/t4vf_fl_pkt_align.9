.SH NAME
t4vf_fl_pkt_align \- return the fl packet alignment
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" t4vf_fl_pkt_align
.BI "(struct adapter *adapter "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "adapter" 12
the adapter

T4 has a single field to specify the packing and padding boundary.
T5 onwards has separate fields for this and hence the alignment for
next packet offset is maximum of these two.  And T6 changes the
Ingress Padding Boundary Shift, so it's all a mess and it's best
if we put this in low-level Common Code ...
