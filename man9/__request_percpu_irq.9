__request_percpu_irq \- allocate a percpu interrupt line
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" __request_percpu_irq
.BI "(unsigned int irq "  ","
.BI "irq_handler_t handler "  ","
.BI "unsigned long flags "  ","
.BI "const char *devname "  ","
.BI "void __percpu *dev_id "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "irq" 12
Interrupt line to allocate
.IP "handler" 12
Function to be called when the IRQ occurs.
.IP "flags" 12
Interrupt type flags (IRQF_TIMER only)
.IP "devname" 12
An ascii name for the claiming device
.IP "dev_id" 12
A percpu cookie passed back to the handler function

This call allocates interrupt resources and enables the
interrupt on the local CPU. If the interrupt is supposed to be
enabled on other CPUs, it has to be done on each CPU using
\fBenable_percpu_irq\fP.

Dev_id must be globally unique. It is a per-cpu variable, and
the handler gets called with the interrupted CPU's instance of
that variable.
