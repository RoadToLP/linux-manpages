.SH NAME
devm_fpga_region_create \- create and initialize a managed FPGA region struct
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "struct fpga_region *" devm_fpga_region_create
.BI "(struct device *dev "  ","
.BI "struct fpga_manager *mgr "  ","
.BI "int (*get_bridges)(struct fpga_region *) "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dev" 12
device parent
.IP "mgr" 12
manager that programs this region
.IP "get_bridges" 12
optional function to get bridges to a list
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function is intended for use in a FPGA region driver's probe function.
After the region driver creates the region struct with
\fBdevm_fpga_region_create\fP, it should register it with \fBfpga_region_register\fP.
The region driver's remove function should call \fBfpga_region_unregister\fP.
The region struct allocated with this function will be freed automatically on
driver detach.  This includes the case of a probe function returning error
before calling \fBfpga_region_register\fP, the struct will still get cleaned up.
.SH "RETURN"
struct fpga_region or NULL
