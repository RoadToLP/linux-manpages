.SH NAME
ehci_xilinx_port_handed_over \- hand the port out if failed to enable it
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" ehci_xilinx_port_handed_over
.BI "(struct usb_hcd *hcd "  ","
.BI "int portnum "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "hcd" 12
Pointer to the usb_hcd device to which the host controller bound
.IP "portnum" 12
Port number to which the device is attached.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function is used as a place to tell the user that the Xilinx USB host
controller does support LS devices. And in an HS only configuration, it
does not support FS devices either. It is hoped that this can help a
confused user.

There are cases when the host controller fails to enable the port due to,
for example, insufficient power that can be supplied to the device from
the USB bus. In those cases, the messages printed here are not helpful.
