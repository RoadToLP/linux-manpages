.SH NAME
fm10k_crc_16b \- Generate a 16 bit CRC for a region of 16 bit data
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "u16" fm10k_crc_16b
.BI "(const u32 *data "  ","
.BI "u16 seed "  ","
.BI "u16 len "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "data" 12
pointer to data to process
.IP "seed" 12
seed value for CRC
.IP "len" 12
length measured in 16 bits words

This function will generate a CRC based on the polynomial 0xAC9A and
whatever value is stored in the seed variable.  Note that this
value inverts the local seed and the result in order to capture all
leading and trailing zeros.
