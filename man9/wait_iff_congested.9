.SH NAME
wait_iff_congested \- Conditionally wait for a backing_dev to become uncongested or a pgdat to complete writes
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "long" wait_iff_congested
.BI "(int sync "  ","
.BI "long timeout "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "sync" 12
SYNC or ASYNC IO
.IP "timeout" 12
timeout in jiffies
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
In the event of a congested backing_dev (any backing_dev) this waits
for up to \fItimeout\fP jiffies for either a BDI to exit congestion of the
given \fIsync\fP queue or a write to complete.

The return value is 0 if the sleep is for the full timeout. Otherwise,
it is the number of jiffies that were still remaining when the function
returned. return_value == timeout implies the function did not sleep.
