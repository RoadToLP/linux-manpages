.SH NAME
ice_sriov_set_msix_res \- Set any used MSIX resources
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" ice_sriov_set_msix_res
.BI "(struct ice_pf *pf "  ","
.BI "u16 num_msix_needed "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "pf" 12
pointer to PF structure
.IP "num_msix_needed" 12
number of MSIX vectors needed for all SR-IOV VFs
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function allows SR-IOV resources to be taken from the end of the PF's
allowed HW MSIX vectors so that the irq_tracker will not be affected. We
just set the pf->sriov_base_vector and return success.

If there are not enough resources available, return an error. This should
always be caught by \fBice_set_per_vf_res\fP.

Return 0 on success, and -EINVAL when there are not enough MSIX vectors
in the PF's space available for SR-IOV.
