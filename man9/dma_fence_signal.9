.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" dma_fence_signal
.BI "(struct dma_fence *fence "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "fence" 12
the fence to signal
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Signal completion for software callbacks on a fence, this will unblock
\fBdma_fence_wait\fP calls and run all the callbacks added with
\fBdma_fence_add_callback\fP. Can be called multiple times, but since a fence
can only go from the unsignaled to the signaled state and not back, it will
only be effective the first time.

Returns 0 on success and a negative error value when \fIfence\fP has been
signalled already.
