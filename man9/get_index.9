.SH ARGUMENTS

video_device to assign index number to, vdev->v4l2_dev should be assigned
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Note that when this is called the new device has not yet been registered
in the video_device array, but it was able to obtain a minor number.

This means that we can always obtain a free stream index number since
the worst case scenario is that there are VIDEO_NUM_DEVICES - 1 slots in
use of the video_device array.

Returns a free index number.
