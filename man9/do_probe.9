.SH ARGUMENTS

command to use

\fBdo_probe\fP has the difficult job of finding a drive if it exists,
without getting hung up if it doesn't exist, without trampling on
ethernet cards, and without leaving any IRQs dangling to haunt us later.

If a drive is "known" to exist (from CMOS or kernel parameters),
but does not respond right away, the probe will "hang in there"
for the maximum wait time (about 30 seconds), otherwise it will
exit much more quickly.
.SH "RETURN"
0  device was identified
1  device timed-out (no response to identify request)
2  device aborted the command (refused to identify itself)
3  bad status from device (possible for ATAPI drives)
4  probe was not attempted because failure was obvious
