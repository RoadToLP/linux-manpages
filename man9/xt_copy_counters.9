.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Copies counter meta data from \fIuser\fP and stores it in \fIinfo\fP.

vmallocs memory to hold the counters, then copies the counter data
from \fIuser\fP to the new memory and returns a pointer to it.

If called from a compat syscall, \fIinfo\fP gets converted automatically to the
64bit representation.

The metadata associated with the counters is stored in \fIinfo\fP.
.SH "RETURN"
returns pointer that caller has to test via \fBIS_ERR\fP.
If IS_ERR is false, caller has to vfree the pointer.
