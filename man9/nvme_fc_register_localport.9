.SH NAME
nvme_fc_register_localport \- transport entry point called by an LLDD to register the existence of a NVME host FC port.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" nvme_fc_register_localport
.BI "(struct nvme_fc_port_info *pinfo "  ","
.BI "struct nvme_fc_port_template *template "  ","
.BI "struct device *dev "  ","
.BI "struct nvme_fc_local_port **portptr "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "pinfo" 12
pointer to information about the port to be registered
.IP "template" 12
LLDD entrypoints and operational parameters for the port
.IP "dev" 12
physical hardware device node port corresponds to. Will be
used for DMA mappings
.IP "portptr" 12
pointer to a local port pointer. Upon success, the routine
will allocate a nvme_fc_local_port structure and place its
address in the local port pointer. Upon failure, local port
pointer will be set to 0.
.SH "RETURN"
a completion status. Must be 0 upon success; a negative errno
(ex: -ENXIO) upon failure.
