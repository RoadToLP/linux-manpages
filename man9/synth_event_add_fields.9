Add a new set of fields to a synthetic event cmd object.  The event

array of struct synth_field_desc, and the number of elements in the
array passed in as n_fields.  Field ordering will retain the
ordering given in the fields array.

See \fBsynth_field_size\fP for available types. If field_name contains
[n] the field is considered to be an array.
