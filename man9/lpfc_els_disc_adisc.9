.SH NAME
lpfc_els_disc_adisc \- Issue remaining adisc iocbs to npr nodes of a vport
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" lpfc_els_disc_adisc
.BI "(struct lpfc_vport *vport "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "vport" 12
pointer to a host virtual N_Port data structure.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This routine issues Address Discover (ADISC) ELS commands to those
N_Ports which are in node port recovery state and ADISC has not been issued
for the \fIvport\fP. Each time an ELS ADISC IOCB is issued by invoking the
\fBlpfc_issue_els_adisc\fP routine, the per \fIvport\fP number of discover count
(num_disc_nodes) shall be incremented. If the num_disc_nodes reaches a
pre-configured threshold (cfg_discovery_threads), the \fIvport\fP fc_flag will
be marked with FC_NLP_MORE bit and the process of issuing remaining ADISC
IOCBs quit for later pick up. On the other hand, after walking through
all the ndlps with the \fIvport\fP and there is none ADISC IOCB issued, the
\fIvport\fP fc_flag shall be cleared with FC_NLP_MORE bit indicating there is
no more ADISC need to be sent.

Return code
The number of N_Ports with adisc issued.
