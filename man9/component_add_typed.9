Register a new component for \fIdev\fP. Functions in \fIops\fP will be call when the
aggregate driver is ready to bind the overall driver by calling
\fBcomponent_bind_all\fP. See also \fIstruct component_ops\fP.

\fIsubcomponent\fP must be nonzero and is used to differentiate between multiple
components registerd on the same device \fIdev\fP. These components are match
using \fBcomponent_match_add_typed\fP.

The component needs to be unregistered at driver unload/disconnect by
calling \fBcomponent_del\fP.

See also \fBcomponent_add\fP.
