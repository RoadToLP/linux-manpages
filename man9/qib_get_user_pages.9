.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function takes a given start page (page aligned user virtual
address) and pins it and the following specified number of pages.  For
now, num_pages is always 1, but that will probably change at some point
(because caller is doing expected sends on a single virtually contiguous
buffer, so we can do all pages at once).
