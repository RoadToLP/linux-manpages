.IP "mask" 12
a mask to apply to the interrupt status
.IP "acts" 12
table of interrupt actions
.IP "stats" 12
statistics counters tracking interrupt occurrences

A table driven interrupt handler that applies a set of masks to an
interrupt status word and performs the corresponding actions if the
interrupts described by the mask have occurred.  The actions include
optionally printing a warning or alert message, and optionally
incrementing a stat counter.  The table is terminated by an entry
specifying mask 0.  Returns the number of fatal interrupt conditions.
