.SH NAME
find_acpi_cpu_topology \- Determine a unique topology value for a given CPU
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" find_acpi_cpu_topology
.BI "(unsigned int cpu "  ","
.BI "int level "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "cpu" 12
Kernel logical CPU number
.IP "level" 12
The topological level for which we would like a unique ID
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Determine a topology unique ID for each thread/core/cluster/mc_grouping
/socket/etc. This ID can then be used to group peers, which will have
matching ids.

The search terminates when either the requested level is found or
we reach a root node. Levels beyond the termination point will return the
same unique ID. The unique id for level 0 is the acpi processor id. All
other levels beyond this use a generated value to uniquely identify
a topological feature.
.SH "RETURN"
-ENOENT if the PPTT doesn't exist, or the CPU cannot be found.
Otherwise returns a value which represents a unique topological feature.
