.B "void" yenta_fixup_parent_bridge
.BI "(struct pci_bus *cardbus_bridge "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "cardbus_bridge" 12
The PCI bus which the CardBus bridge bridges to
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Checks if devices on the bus which the CardBus bridge bridges to would be
invisible during PCI scans because of a misconfigured subordinate number
of the parent brige - some BIOSes seem to be too lazy to set it right.
Does the fixup carefully by checking how far it can go without conflicts.
