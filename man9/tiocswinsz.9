Copies the user idea of the window size to the kernel. Traditionally
this is just advisory information but for the Linux console it
actually has driver level meaning and triggers a VC resize.

Locking:
Driver dependent. The default do_resize method takes the
tty termios mutex and ctrl_lock. The console takes its own lock
then calls into the default method.
