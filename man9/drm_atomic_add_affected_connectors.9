.SH NAME
drm_atomic_add_affected_connectors \- add connectors for CRTC
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" drm_atomic_add_affected_connectors
.BI "(struct drm_atomic_state *state "  ","
.BI "struct drm_crtc *crtc "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "state" 12
atomic state
.IP "crtc" 12
DRM CRTC
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function walks the current configuration and adds all connectors
currently using \fIcrtc\fP to the atomic configuration \fIstate\fP. Note that this
function must acquire the connection mutex. This can potentially cause
unneeded seralization if the update is just for the planes on one CRTC. Hence
drivers and helpers should only call this when really needed (e.g. when a
full modeset needs to happen due to some change).
.SH "RETURN"
0 on success or can fail with -EDEADLK or -ENOMEM. When the error is EDEADLK
then the w/w mutex code has detected a deadlock and the entire atomic
sequence must be restarted. All other errors are fatal.
