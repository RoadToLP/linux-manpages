.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Call the supplied function \fIfn\fP for each registered clockdomain.
The callback function \fIfn\fP can return anything but 0 to bail
out early from the iterator.  The callback function is called with
the clkdm_mutex held, so no clockdomain structure manipulation
functions should be called from the callback, although hardware
clockdomain control functions are fine.  Returns the last return
value of the callback function, which should be 0 for success or
anything else to indicate failure; or -EINVAL if the function pointer
is null.
