.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" sdhci_arasan_update_clockmultiplier
.BI "(struct sdhci_host *host "  ","
.BI "u32 value "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "host" 12

The value to write
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The corecfg_clockmultiplier is supposed to contain clock multiplier
value of programmable clock generator.
.SH "NOTES"
- Many existing devices don't seem to do this and work fine.  To keep
compatibility for old hardware where the device tree doesn't provide a
register map, this function is a noop if a soc_ctl_map hasn't been provided
for this platform.
- The value of corecfg_clockmultiplier should sync with that of corresponding
value reading from sdhci_capability_register. So this function is called
once at probe time and never called again.
