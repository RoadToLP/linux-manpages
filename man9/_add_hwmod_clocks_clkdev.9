_add_hwmod_clocks_clkdev \- Add clkdev entry for hwmod optional clocks and main clock
.SH SYNOPSIS

.BI "(struct omap_device *od "  ","

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
For the main clock and every optional clock present per hwmod per
omap_device, this function adds an entry in the clkdev table of the
form <dev-id=dev_name, con-id=role> if it does not exist already.

The function is called from inside \fBomap_device_build_ss\fP, after
omap_device_register.

This allows drivers to get a pointer to its optional clocks based on its role
by calling clk_get(<dev*>, <role>).
In the case of the main clock, a "fck" alias is used.

No return value.
