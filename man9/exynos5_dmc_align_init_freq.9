.SH NAME
exynos5_dmc_align_init_freq \- Align initial frequency value
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "unsigned long" exynos5_dmc_align_init_freq
.BI "(struct exynos5_dmc *dmc "  ","
.BI "unsigned long bootloader_init_freq "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dmc" 12
device for which the frequency is going to be set
.IP "bootloader_init_freq" 12
initial frequency set by the bootloader in KHz
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The initial bootloader frequency, which is present during boot, might be
different that supported frequency values in the driver. It is possible
due to different PLL settings or used PLL as a source.
This function provides the 'initial_freq' for the devfreq framework
statistics engine which supports only registered values. Thus, some alignment
must be made.
