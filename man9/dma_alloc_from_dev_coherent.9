.SH NAME
dma_alloc_from_dev_coherent \- allocate memory from device coherent pool
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" dma_alloc_from_dev_coherent
.BI "(struct device *dev "  ","
.BI "ssize_t size "  ","
.BI "dma_addr_t *dma_handle "  ","
.BI "void **ret "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dev" 12
device from which we allocate memory
.IP "size" 12
size of requested memory area
.IP "dma_handle" 12
This will be filled with the correct dma handle
.IP "ret" 12
This pointer will be filled with the virtual address
to allocated area.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function should be only called from per-arch \fBdma_alloc_coherent\fP
to support allocation from per-device coherent memory pools.

Returns 0 if dma_alloc_coherent should continue with allocating from
generic memory areas, or !0 if dma_alloc_coherent should return \fIret\fP.
