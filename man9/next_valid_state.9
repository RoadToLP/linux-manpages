next_valid_state \- Find next valid C-state
.SH SYNOPSIS

.BI "(struct cpuidle_device *dev "  ","
.BI "struct cpuidle_driver *drv "  ","
.BI "int index "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dev" 12
cpuidle device
.IP "drv" 12
cpuidle driver
.IP "index" 12
Index of currently selected c-state
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
If the state corresponding to index is valid, index is returned back
to the caller. Else, this function searches for a lower c-state which is
still valid (as defined in omap3_power_states[]) and returns its index.

A state is valid if the 'valid' field is enabled and
if it satisfies the enable_off_mode condition.
