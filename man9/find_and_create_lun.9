.SH NAME
find_and_create_lun \- find or create a local LUN information structure
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "struct llun_info *" find_and_create_lun
.BI "(struct scsi_device *sdev "  ","
.BI "u8 *wwid "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "sdev" 12
SCSI device associated with LUN.
.IP "wwid" 12
WWID associated with LUN.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The LUN is kept both in a local list (per adapter) and in a global list
(across all adapters). Certain attributes of the LUN are local to the
adapter (such as index, port selection mask, etc.).

The block allocation map is shared across all adapters (i.e. associated
wih the global list). Since different attributes are associated with
the per adapter and global entries, allocate two separate structures for each
LUN (one local, one global).

Keep a pointer back from the local to the global entry.

This routine assumes the caller holds the global mutex.
.SH "RETURN"
Found/Allocated local lun_info structure on success, NULL on failure
