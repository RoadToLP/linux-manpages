.SH NAME
aa_dfa_matchn_until \- traverse @dfa until accept or @n bytes consumed
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "unsigned int" aa_dfa_matchn_until
.BI "(struct aa_dfa *dfa "  ","
.BI "unsigned int start "  ","
.BI "const char *str "  ","
.BI "int n "  ","
.BI "const char **retpos "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dfa" 12
the dfa to match \fIstr\fP against  (NOT NULL)
.IP "start" 12
the state of the dfa to start matching in
.IP "str" 12
the string of bytes to match against the dfa  (NOT NULL)
.IP "n" 12
length of the string of bytes to match
.IP "retpos" 12
first character in str after match OR str + n
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
aa_dfa_match_len will match \fIstr\fP against the dfa and return the state it
finished matching in. The final state can be used to look up the accepting
label, or as the start state of a continuing match.

This function will happily match again the 0 byte and only finishes
when \fIn\fP input is consumed.
.SH "RETURN"
final state reached after input is consumed
