.SH NAME
drm_plane_create_zpos_property \- create mutable zpos property
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" drm_plane_create_zpos_property
.BI "(struct drm_plane *plane "  ","
.BI "unsigned int zpos "  ","
.BI "unsigned int min "  ","
.BI "unsigned int max "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "plane" 12
drm plane
.IP "zpos" 12
initial value of zpos property
.IP "min" 12
minimal possible value of zpos property
.IP "max" 12
maximal possible value of zpos property
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function initializes generic mutable zpos property and enables support
for it in drm core. Drivers can then attach this property to planes to enable
support for configurable planes arrangement during blending operation.
Drivers that attach a mutable zpos property to any plane should call the
\fBdrm_atomic_normalize_zpos\fP helper during their implementation of
\fIdrm_mode_config_funcs\fP.\fBatomic_check\fP, which will update the normalized zpos
values and store them in \fIdrm_plane_state.normalized_zpos\fP. Usually min
should be set to 0 and max to maximal number of planes for given crtc - 1.

If zpos of some planes cannot be changed (like fixed background or
cursor/topmost planes), drivers shall adjust the min/max values and assign
those planes immutable zpos properties with lower or higher values (for more
information, see \fBdrm_plane_create_zpos_immutable_property\fP function). In such
case drivers shall also assign proper initial zpos values for all planes in
its \fBplane_reset\fP callback, so the planes will be always sorted properly.

See also \fBdrm_atomic_normalize_zpos\fP.

The property exposed to userspace is called "zpos".
.SH "RETURN"
Zero on success, negative errno on failure.
