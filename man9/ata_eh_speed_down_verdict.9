ata_eh_speed_down_verdict \- Determine speed down verdict
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "unsigned int" ata_eh_speed_down_verdict
.BI "(struct ata_device *dev "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dev" 12
Device of interest

This function examines error ring of \fIdev\fP and determines
whether NCQ needs to be turned off, transfer speed should be
stepped down, or falling back to PIO is necessary.

ECAT_ATA_BUS    : ATA_BUS error for any command

ECAT_TOUT_HSM   : TIMEOUT for any command or HSM violation for
IO commands

ECAT_UNK_DEV    : Unknown DEV error for IO commands

ECAT_DUBIOUS_*  : Identical to above three but occurred while
data transfer hasn't been verified.

Verdicts are

NCQ_OFF         : Turn off NCQ.

SPEED_DOWN      : Speed down transfer speed but don't fall back
to PIO.

FALLBACK_TO_PIO : Fall back to PIO.

Even if multiple verdicts are returned, only one action is
taken per error.  An action triggered by non-DUBIOUS errors
clears ering, while one triggered by DUBIOUS_* errors doesn't.
This is to expedite speed down decisions right after device is
initially configured.

The following are speed down rules.  #1 and #2 deal with
DUBIOUS errors.

1. If more than one DUBIOUS_ATA_BUS or DUBIOUS_TOUT_HSM errors
occurred during last 5 mins, SPEED_DOWN and FALLBACK_TO_PIO.

2. If more than one DUBIOUS_TOUT_HSM or DUBIOUS_UNK_DEV errors
occurred during last 5 mins, NCQ_OFF.

3. If more than 8 ATA_BUS, TOUT_HSM or UNK_DEV errors
occurred during last 5 mins, FALLBACK_TO_PIO

4. If more than 3 TOUT_HSM or UNK_DEV errors occurred
during last 10 mins, NCQ_OFF.

5. If more than 3 ATA_BUS or TOUT_HSM errors, or more than 6
UNK_DEV errors occurred during last 10 mins, SPEED_DOWN.

LOCKING:
