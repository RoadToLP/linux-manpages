.SH NAME
snd_jack_set_key \- Set a key mapping on a jack
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" snd_jack_set_key
.BI "(struct snd_jack *jack "  ","
.BI "enum snd_jack_types type "  ","
.BI "int keytype "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "jack" 12
The jack to configure
.IP "type" 12
Jack report type for this key
.IP "keytype" 12
Input layer key type to be reported
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Map a SND_JACK_BTN_* button type to an input layer key, allowing
reporting of keys on accessories via the jack abstraction.  If no
mapping is provided but keys are enabled in the jack type then
BTN_n numeric buttons will be reported.

If jacks are not reporting via the input API this call will have no
effect.

Note that this is intended to be use by simple devices with small
numbers of keys that can be reported.  It is also possible to
access the input device directly - devices with complex input
capabilities on accessories should consider doing this rather than
using this abstraction.

This function may only be called prior to registration of the jack.
.SH "RETURN"
Zero if successful, or a negative error code on failure.
