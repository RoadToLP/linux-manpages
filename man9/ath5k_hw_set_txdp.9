.BI "unsigned int queue "  ","
.BI "u32 phys_addr "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "ah" 12
The \fIstruct ath5k_hw\fP
.IP "queue" 12
The hw queue number
.IP "phys_addr" 12
The physical address
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Set TX descriptor's address for a specific queue. For 5210 we ignore
the queue number and we use tx queue type since we only have 2 queues
so as above we use TXDP0 for normal data queue and TXDP1 for beacon queue.
For newer chips with QCU/DCU we just set the corresponding TXDP register.
Returns -EINVAL if queue type is invalid for 5210 and -EIO if queue is still
active.
