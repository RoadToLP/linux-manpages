Ring to stop
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Must not be invoked from a callback.

This method will disable the ring. Further calls to
tb_ring_tx/tb_ring_rx will return -ESHUTDOWN until ring_stop has been
called.

All enqueued frames will be canceled and their callbacks will be executed
with frame->canceled set to true (on the callback thread). This method
returns only after all callback invocations have finished.
