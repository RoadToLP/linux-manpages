We're typically called here to update the state of an Ethernet TX
Queue with respect to the hardware's progress in consuming the TX
Work Requests that we've put on that Egress Queue.  This happens
when we get Egress Queue Update messages and also prophylactically
in regular timer-based Ethernet TX Queue maintenance.
