The adis device
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The function performs a HW reset via a reset pin that should be specified
via GPIOLIB. If no pin is configured a SW reset will be performed.
The RST pin for the ADIS devices should be configured as ACTIVE_LOW.

After the self-test operation is performed, the function will also check
that the product ID is as expected. This assumes that drivers providing
'prod_id_reg' will also provide the 'prod_id'.

Returns 0 if the device is operational, a negative error code otherwise.

This function should be called early on in the device initialization sequence
to ensure that the device is in a sane and known state and that it is usable.
