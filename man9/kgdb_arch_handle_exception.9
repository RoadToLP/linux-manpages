kgdb_arch_handle_exception \- Handle architecture specific GDB packets.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" kgdb_arch_handle_exception
.BI "(int e_vector "  ","
.BI "int signo "  ","
.BI "int err_code "  ","
.BI "char *remcomInBuffer "  ","

.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "e_vector" 12
The error vector of the exception that happened.
.IP "signo" 12
The signal number of the exception that happened.
.IP "err_code" 12
The error code of the exception that happened.
.IP "remcomInBuffer" 12
The buffer of the packet we have read.
.IP "remcomOutBuffer" 12
The buffer of BUFMAX bytes to write a packet into.
.IP "linux_regs" 12
The \fIstruct pt_regs\fP of the current process.

This function MUST handle the 'c' and 's' command packets,
as well packets to set / remove a hardware breakpoint, if used.
If there are additional packets which the hardware needs to handle,
they are handled here.  The code should return -1 if it wants to
process more packets, and a 0 or 1 if it wants to exit from the
kgdb callback.
