This function is called every time an UBI volume is updated. It does nothing
if te volume \fIvol\fP is dynamic, and changes MTD device size if the
volume is static. This is needed because static volumes cannot be read past
data they contain. This function returns zero in case of success and a
negative error code in case of error.
