.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Calculate and update the positions of index nodes to commit.  If there were
an insufficient number of empty LEBs allocated, then index nodes are placed
into the gaps created by obsolete index nodes in non-empty index LEBs.  For
this purpose, an obsolete index node is one that was not in the index as at
the end of the last commit.  To write "in-the-gaps" requires that those index
LEBs are updated atomically in-place.
