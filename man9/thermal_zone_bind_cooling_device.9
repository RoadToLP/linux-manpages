.SH NAME
thermal_zone_bind_cooling_device \- bind a cooling device to a thermal zone
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" thermal_zone_bind_cooling_device
.BI "(struct thermal_zone_device *tz "  ","
.BI "int trip "  ","
.BI "struct thermal_cooling_device *cdev "  ","
.BI "unsigned long upper "  ","
.BI "unsigned long lower "  ","
.BI "unsigned int weight "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "tz" 12
pointer to struct thermal_zone_device
.IP "trip" 12
indicates which trip point the cooling devices is
associated with in this thermal zone.
.IP "cdev" 12
pointer to struct thermal_cooling_device
.IP "upper" 12
the Maximum cooling state for this trip point.
THERMAL_NO_LIMIT means no upper limit,
and the cooling device can be in max_state.
.IP "lower" 12
the Minimum cooling state can be used for this trip point.
THERMAL_NO_LIMIT means no lower limit,
and the cooling device can be in cooling state 0.
.IP "weight" 12
The weight of the cooling device to be bound to the
thermal zone. Use THERMAL_WEIGHT_DEFAULT for the
default value
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This interface function bind a thermal cooling device to the certain trip
point of a thermal zone device.
This function is usually called in the thermal zone device .bind callback.
.SH "RETURN"
0 on success, the proper error value otherwise.
