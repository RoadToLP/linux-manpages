.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "phys_addr" 12
the physical address to validate
.IP "parent" 12
if not NULL, then this is filled with the parents PA.
.IP "port" 12

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This validates a physical address as read from an EDID. If the
PA is invalid (such as 1.0.1.0 since '0' is only allowed at the end),
then it will return -EINVAL.

The parent PA is passed into parent and the input port is passed into
port. For example:

PA = 0.0.0.0: has parent 0.0.0.0 and input port 0.

PA = 1.0.0.0: has parent 0.0.0.0 and input port 1.

PA = 3.2.0.0: has parent 3.0.0.0 and input port 2.

PA = f.f.f.f: has parent f.f.f.f and input port 0.
.SH "RETURN"
0 if the PA is valid, -EINVAL if not.
