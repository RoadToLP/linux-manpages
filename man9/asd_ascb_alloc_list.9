.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This is the only function which is used to allocate aSCBs.
It can allocate one or many. If more than one, then they form
a linked list in two ways: by their list field of the ascb struct
and by the next_scb field of the scb_header.

Returns NULL if no memory was available, else pointer to a list
of ascbs.  When this function returns, \fInum\fP would be the number
of SCBs which were not able to be allocated, 0 if all requested
were able to be allocated.
