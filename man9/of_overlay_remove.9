.SH NAME
of_overlay_remove \- Revert and free an overlay changeset
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" of_overlay_remove
.BI "(int *ovcs_id "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "ovcs_id" 12
Pointer to overlay changeset id
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Removes an overlay if it is permissible.  \fIovcs_id\fP was previously returned
by \fBof_overlay_fdt_apply\fP.

If an error occurred while attempting to revert the overlay changeset,
then an attempt is made to re-apply any changeset entry that was
reverted.  If an error occurs on re-apply then the state of the device
tree can not be determined, and any following attempt to apply or remove
an overlay changeset will be refused.

A non-zero return value will not revert the changeset if error is from:
- parameter checks
- overlay changeset pre-remove notifier
- overlay changeset entry revert

If an error is returned by an overlay changeset pre-remove notifier
then no further overlay changeset pre-remove notifier will be called.

If more than one notifier returns an error, then the last notifier
error to occur is returned.

A non-zero return value will revert the changeset if error is from:
- overlay changeset entry notifier
- overlay changeset post-remove notifier

If an error is returned by an overlay changeset post-remove notifier
then no further overlay changeset post-remove notifier will be called.

Returns 0 on success, or a negative error number.  *ovcs_id is set to
zero after reverting the changeset, even if a subsequent error occurs.
