.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This routine is used to declare an I2C adapter when its bus number
doesn't matter or when its bus number is specified by an dt alias.
Examples of bases when the bus number doesn't matter: I2C adapters
dynamically added by USB links or PCI plugin cards.

When this returns zero, a new bus number was allocated and stored
in adap->nr, and the specified adapter became available for clients.
Otherwise, a negative errno value is returned.
