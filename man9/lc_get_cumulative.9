.SH NAME
lc_get_cumulative \- like lc_get; also finds to-be-changed elements
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "struct lc_element *" lc_get_cumulative
.BI "(struct lru_cache *lc "  ","
.BI "unsigned int enr "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "lc" 12
the lru cache to operate on
.IP "enr" 12
the label to look up
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Unlike lc_get this also returns the element for \fIenr\fP, if it is belonging to
a pending transaction, so the return values are like for \fBlc_get\fP,
plus:

pointer to an element already on the "to_be_changed" list.
In this case, the cache was already marked LC_DIRTY.

Caller needs to make sure that the pending transaction is completed,
before proceeding to actually use this element.
