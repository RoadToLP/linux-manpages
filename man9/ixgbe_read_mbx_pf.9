.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "hw" 12
pointer to the HW structure
.IP "msg" 12
The message buffer
.IP "size" 12
Length of buffer
.IP "vf_number" 12

This function copies a message from the mailbox buffer to the caller's
memory buffer.  The presumption is that the caller knows that there was
a message due to a VF request so no polling for message is needed.
