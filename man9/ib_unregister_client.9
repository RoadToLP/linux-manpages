Client to unregister
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Upper level users use \fBib_unregister_client\fP to remove their client
registration.  When \fBib_unregister_client\fP is called, the client
will receive a remove callback for each IB device still registered.

This is a full fence, once it returns no client callbacks will be called,
or are running in another thread.
