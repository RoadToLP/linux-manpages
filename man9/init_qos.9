RSM map table
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This routine initializes Rule 0 and the RSM map table to implement
quality of service (qos).

If all of the limit tests succeed, qos is applied based on the array
interpretation of krcvqs where entry 0 is VL0.

The number of vl bits (n) and the number of qpn bits (m) are computed to
feed both the RSM map table and the single rule.
