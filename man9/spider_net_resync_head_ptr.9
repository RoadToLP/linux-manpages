.SH "DESCRIPTION"
If the driver fails to keep up and empty the queue, then the
hardware wil run out of room to put incoming packets. This
will cause the hardware to skip descrs that are full (instead
of halting/retrying). Thus, once the driver runs, it wil need
to "catch up" to where the hardware chain pointer is at.
