.SH NAME
rpaphp_add_slot \- - declare a hotplug slot to the hotplug subsystem.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" rpaphp_add_slot
.BI "(struct device_node *dn "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dn" 12
device node of slot
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This subroutine will register a hotpluggable slot with the
PCI hotplug infrastructure. This routine is typically called
during boot time, if the hotplug slots are present at boot time,
or is called later, by the dlpar add code, if the slot is
being dynamically added during runtime.

If the device node points at an embedded (built-in) slot, this
routine will just return without doing anything, since embedded
slots cannot be hotplugged.

To remove a slot, it suffices to call \fBrpaphp_deregister_slot\fP.
