The event identifier.
.IP "flags" 12

Disables the specified event on the EC. This function does not manage
reference counting of enabled events and is basically only a wrapper for
the raw EC request. If the specified event is already disabled, the EC will
ignore this request.
.SH "RETURN"
Returns the status of the executed SAM request (zero on success and
negative on direct failure) or -EPROTO if the request response indicates a
failure.
