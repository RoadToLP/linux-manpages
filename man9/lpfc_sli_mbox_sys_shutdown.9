.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function is called to shutdown the driver's mailbox sub-system.
It first marks the mailbox sub-system is in a block state to prevent
the asynchronous mailbox command from issued off the pending mailbox
command queue. If the mailbox command sub-system shutdown is due to
HBA error conditions such as EEH or ERATT, this routine shall invoke
the mailbox sub-system flush routine to forcefully bring down the
mailbox sub-system. Otherwise, if it is due to normal condition (such
as with offline or HBA function reset), this routine will wait for the
outstanding mailbox command to complete before invoking the mailbox
sub-system flush routine to gracefully bring down mailbox sub-system.
