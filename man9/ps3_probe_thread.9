.SH "DESCRIPTION"

This implementation only supports background probing on a single bus.
It uses the hypervisor's storage device notification mechanism to wait until
a storage device is ready.  The device notification mechanism uses a
pseudo device to asynchronously notify the guest when storage devices become
ready.  The notification device has a block size of 512 bytes.
