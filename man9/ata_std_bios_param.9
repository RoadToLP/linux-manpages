.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "sdev" 12
SCSI device for which BIOS geometry is to be determined
.IP "bdev" 12
block device associated with \fIsdev\fP
.IP "capacity" 12
capacity of SCSI device
.IP "geom" 12
location to which geometry will be output

Generic bios head/sector/cylinder calculator
used by sd. Most BIOSes nowadays expect a XXX/255/16  (CHS)
mapping. Some situations may arise where the disk is not
bootable if this is not used.

LOCKING:
Defined by the SCSI layer.  We don't really care.
.SH "RETURN"
Zero.
