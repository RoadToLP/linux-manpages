.SH NAME
region_intersects \- determine intersection of region with known resources
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" region_intersects
.BI "(resource_size_t start "  ","
.BI "size_t size "  ","
.BI "unsigned long flags "  ","
.BI "unsigned long desc "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "start" 12
region start address
.IP "size" 12
size of region
.IP "flags" 12
flags of resource (in iomem_resource)
.IP "desc" 12
descriptor of resource (in iomem_resource) or IORES_DESC_NONE
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Check if the specified region partially overlaps or fully eclipses a
resource identified by \fIflags\fP and \fIdesc\fP (optional with IORES_DESC_NONE).
Return REGION_DISJOINT if the region does not overlap \fIflags\fP/\fIdesc\fP,
return REGION_MIXED if the region overlaps \fIflags\fP/\fIdesc\fP and another
resource, and return REGION_INTERSECTS if the region overlaps \fIflags\fP/\fIdesc\fP
and no other defined resource. Note that REGION_INTERSECTS is also
returned in the case when the specified region overlaps RAM and undefined
memory holes.

\fBregion_intersect\fP is used by memory remapping functions to ensure
the user is not remapping RAM and is a vast speed up over walking
through the resource table page by page.
