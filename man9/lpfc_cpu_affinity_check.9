.SH NAME
lpfc_cpu_affinity_check \- Check vector CPU affinity mappings
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" lpfc_cpu_affinity_check
.BI "(struct lpfc_hba *phba "  ","
.BI "int vectors "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "phba" 12
pointer to lpfc hba data structure.
.IP "vectors" 12
number of msix vectors allocated.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The routine will figure out the CPU affinity assignment for every
MSI-X vector allocated for the HBA.
In addition, the CPU to IO channel mapping will be calculated
and the phba->sli4_hba.cpu_map array will reflect this.
