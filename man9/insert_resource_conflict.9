.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "struct resource *" insert_resource_conflict
.BI "(struct resource *parent "  ","
.BI "struct resource *new "  ");"

.IP "parent" 12

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Returns 0 on success, conflict resource if the resource can't be inserted.

This function is equivalent to request_resource_conflict when no conflict
happens. If a conflict happens, and the conflicting resources
entirely fit within the range of the new resource, then the new
resource is inserted and the conflicting resources become children of
the new resource.

This function is intended for producers of resources, such as FW modules
and bus drivers.
