.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "long" v4l2_compat_ioctl32
.BI "(struct file *file "  ","
.BI "unsigned int cmd "  ","
.BI "unsigned long arg "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "file" 12
pointer to \fIstruct file\fP with the file handler
.IP "cmd" 12
ioctl to be called
.IP "arg" 12
arguments passed from/to the ioctl handler
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function is meant to be used as .compat_ioctl fops at v4l2-dev.c
in order to deal with 32-bit calls on a 64-bits Kernel.

This function calls \fBdo_video_ioctl\fP for non-private V4L2 ioctls.
If the function is a private one it calls vdev->fops->compat_ioctl32
instead.
