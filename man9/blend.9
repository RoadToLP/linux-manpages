.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "vaddr_dst" 12
destination address

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Blend the vaddr_src value with the vaddr_dst value using the pre-multiplied
alpha blending equation, since DRM currently assumes that the pixel color
values have already been pre-multiplied with the alpha channel values. See
more \fBdrm_plane_create_blend_mode_property\fP. This function uses buffer's
metadata to locate the new composite values at vaddr_dst.
