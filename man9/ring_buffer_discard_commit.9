.SH NAME
ring_buffer_discard_commit \- discard an event that has not been committed
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" ring_buffer_discard_commit
.BI "(struct trace_buffer *buffer "  ","
.BI "struct ring_buffer_event *event "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "buffer" 12
the ring buffer
.IP "event" 12
non committed event to discard
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Sometimes an event that is in the ring buffer needs to be ignored.
This function lets the user discard an event in the ring buffer
and then that event will not be read later.

This function only works if it is called before the item has been
committed. It will try to free the event from the ring buffer
if another event has not been added behind it.

If another event has been added behind it, it will set the event
up as discarded, and perform the commit.

If this function is called, do not call ring_buffer_unlock_commit on
the event.
