.SH "DESCRIPTION"
If we had been in RCU mode, drop out of it and legitimize nd->path.
Revalidate the final result, unless we'd already done that during
the path walk or the filesystem doesn't ask for it.  Return 0 on
success, -error on failure.  In case of failure caller does not
need to drop nd->path.
