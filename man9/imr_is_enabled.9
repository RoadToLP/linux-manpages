.SH NAME
imr_is_enabled \- true if an IMR is enabled false otherwise.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" imr_is_enabled
.BI "(struct imr_regs *imr "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "imr" 12
pointer to IMR descriptor.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Determines if an IMR is enabled based on address range and read/write
mask. An IMR set with an address range set to zero and a read/write
access mask set to all is considered to be disabled. An IMR in any
other state - for example set to zero but without read/write access
all is considered to be enabled. This definition of disabled is how
firmware switches off an IMR and is maintained in kernel for
consistency.
.SH "RETURN"
true if IMR enabled false if disabled.
