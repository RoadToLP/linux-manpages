power domain to reference
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function grabs a power domain reference for \fIdomain\fP and ensures that the
power domain and all its parents are powered up. Therefore users should only
grab a reference to the innermost power domain they need.

Any power domain reference obtained by this function must have a symmetric
call to \fBintel_display_power_put\fP to release the reference again.
