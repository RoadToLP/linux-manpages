the interrupt description structure for this irq

Interrupt occures on the falling and/or rising edge of a hardware
signal. The occurrence is latched into the irq controller hardware
and must be acked in order to be reenabled. After the ack another
interrupt can happen on the same source even before the first one
is handled by the associated event handler. If this happens it
might be necessary to disable (mask) the interrupt depending on the
controller hardware. This requires to reenable the interrupt inside
of the loop which handles the interrupts which have arrived while
the handler was running. If all pending interrupts are handled, the
loop is left.
