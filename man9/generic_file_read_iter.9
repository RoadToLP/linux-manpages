.SH NAME
generic_file_read_iter \- generic filesystem read routine
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "ssize_t" generic_file_read_iter
.BI "(struct kiocb *iocb "  ","
.BI "struct iov_iter *iter "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "iocb" 12
kernel I/O control block
.IP "iter" 12
destination for the data read
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This is the "\fBread_iter\fP" routine for all filesystems
that can use the page cache directly.

The IOCB_NOWAIT flag in iocb->ki_flags indicates that -EAGAIN shall
be returned when no data can be read without waiting for I/O requests
to complete; it doesn't prevent readahead.

The IOCB_NOIO flag in iocb->ki_flags indicates that no new I/O
requests shall be made for the read or for readahead.  When no data
can be read, -EAGAIN shall be returned.  When readahead would be
triggered, a partial, possibly empty read shall be returned.
.SH "RETURN"
* number of bytes copied, even for partial reads
* negative error code (or 0 if IOCB_NOIO) if nothing was read
