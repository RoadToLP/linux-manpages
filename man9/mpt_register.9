.SH NAME
mpt_register \- Register protocol-specific main callback handler.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "u8" mpt_register
.BI "(MPT_CALLBACK cbfunc "  ","
.BI "MPT_DRIVER_CLASS dclass "  ","
.BI "char *func_name "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "cbfunc" 12
callback function pointer
.IP "dclass" 12
Protocol driver's class (MPT_DRIVER_CLASS enum value)
.IP "func_name" 12
call function's name

This routine is called by a protocol-specific driver (SCSI host,
LAN, SCSI target) to register its reply callback routine.  Each
protocol-specific driver must do this before it will be able to
use any IOC resources, such as obtaining request frames.
.SH "NOTES"
The SCSI protocol driver currently calls this routine thrice
in order to register separate callbacks; one for "normal" SCSI IO;
one for MptScsiTaskMgmt requests; one for Scan/DV requests.

Returns u8 valued "handle" in the range (and S.O.D. order)
{N,...,7,6,5,...,1} if successful.
A return value of MPT_MAX_PROTOCOL_DRIVERS (including zero!) should be
considered an error by the caller.
