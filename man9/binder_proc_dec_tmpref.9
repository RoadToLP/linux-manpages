.SH "DESCRIPTION"
A binder_proc needs to be kept alive while being used to create or
handle a transaction. proc->tmp_ref is incremented when
creating a new transaction or the binder_proc is currently in-use
by threads that are being released. When done with the binder_proc,
this function is called to decrement the counter and free the
proc if appropriate (proc has been released, all threads have
been released and not currenly in-use to process a transaction).
