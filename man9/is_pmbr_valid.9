.SH NAME
is_pmbr_valid \- test Protective MBR for validity
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" is_pmbr_valid
.BI "(legacy_mbr *mbr "  ","
.BI "sector_t total_sectors "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "mbr" 12
pointer to a legacy mbr structure
.IP "total_sectors" 12
amount of sectors in the device
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Checks for a valid protective or hybrid
master boot record (MBR). The validity of a pMBR depends
on all of the following properties:
1) MSDOS signature is in the last two bytes of the MBR
2) One partition of type 0xEE is found

In addition, a hybrid MBR will have up to three additional
primary partitions, which point to the same space that's
marked out by up to three GPT partitions.

Returns 0 upon invalid MBR, or GPT_MBR_PROTECTIVE or
GPT_MBR_HYBRID depending on the device layout.
