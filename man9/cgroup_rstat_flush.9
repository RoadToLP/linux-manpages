Collect all per-cpu stats in \fIcgrp\fP's subtree into the global counters
and propagate them upwards.  After this function returns, all cgroups in
the subtree have up-to-date ->stat.

This also gets all cgroups in the subtree including \fIcgrp\fP off the
->updated_children lists.

This function may block.
