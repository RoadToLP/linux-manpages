tty_unthrottle_safe \- flow control
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" tty_unthrottle_safe
.BI "(struct tty_struct *tty "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "tty" 12
terminal

Similar to \fBtty_unthrottle\fP but will only attempt unthrottle
if tty->flow_change is TTY_UNTHROTTLE_SAFE. Prevents an accidental
unthrottle due to race conditions when unthrottling is conditional
on factors evaluated prior to unthrottling.

Returns 0 if tty is unthrottled (or was already unthrottled)
