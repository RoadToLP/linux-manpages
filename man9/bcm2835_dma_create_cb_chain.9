.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "chan" 12
the \fIdma_chan\fP for which we run this
.IP "direction" 12
the direction in which we transfer
.IP "cyclic" 12
it is a cyclic transfer
.IP "info" 12
the default info bits to apply per controlblock
.IP "finalextrainfo" 12
additional bits in last controlblock
(or when period_len is reached in case of cyclic)
.IP "frames" 12
number of controlblocks to allocate
.IP "src" 12
the src address to assign (if the S_INC bit is set
in \fIinfo\fP, then it gets incremented)
.IP "dst" 12
the dst address to assign (if the D_INC bit is set
in \fIinfo\fP, then it gets incremented)
.IP "buf_len" 12
the full buffer length (may also be 0)
.IP "period_len" 12
the period length when to apply \fIfinalextrainfo\fP
in addition to the last transfer
this will also break some control-blocks early
.IP "gfp" 12
the GFP flag to use for allocation
