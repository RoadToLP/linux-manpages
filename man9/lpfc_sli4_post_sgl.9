.SH NAME
lpfc_sli4_post_sgl \- Post scatter gather list for an XRI to HBA
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" lpfc_sli4_post_sgl
.BI "(struct lpfc_hba *phba "  ","
.BI "dma_addr_t pdma_phys_addr0 "  ","
.BI "dma_addr_t pdma_phys_addr1 "  ","
.BI "uint16_t xritag "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "phba" 12
The virtual port for which this call being executed.
.IP "pdma_phys_addr0" 12
Physical address of the 1st SGL page.
.IP "pdma_phys_addr1" 12
Physical address of the 2nd SGL page.
.IP "xritag" 12
the xritag that ties this io to the SGL pages.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This routine will post the sgl pages for the IO that has the xritag
that is in the iocbq structure. The xritag is assigned during iocbq
creation and persists for as long as the driver is loaded.
if the caller has fewer than 256 scatter gather segments to map then
pdma_phys_addr1 should be 0.
If the caller needs to map more than 256 scatter gather segment then
pdma_phys_addr1 should be a valid physical address.
physical address for SGLs must be 64 byte aligned.
If you are going to map 2 SGL's then the first one must have 256 entries
the second sgl can have between 1 and 256 entries.

Return codes:
0 - Success
-ENXIO, -ENOMEM - Failure
