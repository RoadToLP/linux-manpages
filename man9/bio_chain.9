.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The caller won't have a bi_end_io called when \fIbio\fP completes - instead,
\fIparent\fP's bi_end_io won't be called until both \fIparent\fP and \fIbio\fP have
completed; the chained bio will also be freed when it completes.

The caller must not set bi_private or bi_end_io in \fIbio\fP.
