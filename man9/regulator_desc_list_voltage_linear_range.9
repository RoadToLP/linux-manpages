.SH NAME
regulator_desc_list_voltage_linear_range \- List voltages for linear ranges
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" regulator_desc_list_voltage_linear_range
.BI "(const struct regulator_desc *desc "  ","
.BI "unsigned int selector "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "desc" 12
Regulator desc for regulator which volatges are to be listed
.IP "selector" 12
Selector to convert into a voltage
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Regulators with a series of simple linear mappings between voltages
and selectors who have set linear_ranges in the regulator descriptor
can use this function prior regulator registration to list voltages.
This is useful when voltages need to be listed during device-tree
parsing.
