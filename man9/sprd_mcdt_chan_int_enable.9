.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Now it only can enable fifo almost full interrupt for ADC channel and fifo
almost empty interrupt for DAC channel. Morevoer for interrupt mode, user
should use \fBsprd_mcdt_chan_read\fP or \fBsprd_mcdt_chan_write\fP to read or write
data manually.

For ADC channel, user can start to read data once receiving one fifo full
interrupt. For DAC channel, user can start to write data once receiving one
fifo empty interrupt or just call \fBsprd_mcdt_chan_write\fP to write data
directly.

Returns 0 on success, or an error code on failure.
