.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function re-enables the output polling work, after it has been
temporarily disabled using \fBdrm_kms_helper_poll_disable\fP, for example over
suspend/resume.

Drivers can call this helper from their device resume implementation. It is
not an error to call this even when output polling isn't enabled.

Note that calls to enable and disable polling must be strictly ordered, which
is automatically the case when they're only call from suspend/resume
callbacks.
