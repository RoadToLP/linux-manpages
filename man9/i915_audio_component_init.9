.SH NAME
i915_audio_component_init \- initialize and register the audio component
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" i915_audio_component_init
.BI "(struct drm_i915_private *dev_priv "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dev_priv" 12
i915 device instance
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This will register with the component framework a child component which
will bind dynamically to the snd_hda_intel driver's corresponding master
component when the latter is registered. During binding the child
initializes an instance of struct i915_audio_component which it receives
from the master. The master can then start to use the interface defined by
this struct. Each side can break the binding at any point by deregistering
its own component after which each side's component unbind callback is
called.

We ignore any error during registration and continue with reduced
functionality (i.e. without HDMI audio).
