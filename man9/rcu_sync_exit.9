.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function is used by updaters who have completed, and can therefore
now allow readers to make use of their fastpaths after a grace period
has elapsed.  After this grace period has completed, all subsequent
calls to \fBrcu_sync_is_idle\fP will return true, which tells readers that
they can once again use their fastpaths.
