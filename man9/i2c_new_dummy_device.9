i2c_new_dummy_device \- return a new i2c device bound to a dummy driver
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "struct i2c_client *" i2c_new_dummy_device

.BI "u16 address "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "adapter" 12
the adapter managing the device
.IP "address" 12
seven bit address to be used
.SH "CONTEXT"
can sleep
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This returns an I2C client bound to the "dummy" driver, intended for use
with devices that consume multiple addresses.  Examples of such chips
include various EEPROMS (like 24c04 and 24c08 models).

These dummy devices have two main uses.  First, most I2C and SMBus calls
except \fBi2c_transfer\fP need a client handle; the dummy will be that handle.
And second, this prevents the specified address from being bound to a
different driver.

This returns the new i2c client, which should be saved for later use with
\fBi2c_unregister_device\fP; or an ERR_PTR to describe the error.
