.SH NAME
__get_nr_free_mft_records \- return the number of free inodes on a volume
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "unsigned long" __get_nr_free_mft_records
.BI "(ntfs_volume *vol "  ","
.BI "s64 nr_free "  ","
.BI "const pgoff_t max_index "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "vol" 12
ntfs volume for which to obtain free inode count
.IP "nr_free" 12
number of mft records in filesystem
.IP "max_index" 12
maximum number of pages containing set bits
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Calculate the number of free mft records (inodes) on the mounted NTFS
volume \fIvol\fP. We actually calculate the number of mft records in use instead
because this allows us to not care about partial pages as these will be just
zero filled and hence not be counted as allocated mft record.

If any pages cannot be read we assume all mft records in the erroring pages
are in use. This means we return an underestimate on errors which is better
than an overestimate.
.SH "NOTE"
Caller must hold mftbmp_lock rw_semaphore for reading or writing.
