.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "vport" 12
Pointer to virtual port.
.IP "pring" 12
Pointer to driver SLI ring object.
.IP "tgt_id" 12
SCSI ID of the target.
.IP "lun_id" 12
LUN ID of the scsi device.
.IP "cmd" 12

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function sends an abort command for every SCSI command
associated with the given virtual port pending on the ring
filtered by lpfc_sli_validate_fcp_iocb function.
When taskmgmt_cmd == LPFC_CTX_LUN, the function sends abort only to the
FCP iocbs associated with lun specified by tgt_id and lun_id
parameters
When taskmgmt_cmd == LPFC_CTX_TGT, the function sends abort only to the
FCP iocbs associated with SCSI target specified by tgt_id parameter.
When taskmgmt_cmd == LPFC_CTX_HOST, the function sends abort to all
FCP iocbs associated with virtual port.
This function returns number of iocbs it aborted .
This function is called with no locks held right after a taskmgmt
command is sent.
