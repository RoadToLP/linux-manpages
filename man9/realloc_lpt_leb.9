.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function duplicates exactly the results of the function alloc_lpt_leb.
It is used during end commit to reallocate the same LEB numbers that were
allocated by alloc_lpt_leb during start commit.

This function finds the next LEB that was allocated by the alloc_lpt_leb
function starting from \fIlnum\fP. If a LEB is found it is returned in \fIlnum\fP and
the function returns 0. Otherwise the function returns -ENOSPC.
Note however, that LPT is designed never to run out of space.
