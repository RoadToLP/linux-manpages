.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The \fBsimple_read_from_buffer\fP function reads up to \fIcount\fP bytes from the
buffer \fIfrom\fP at offset \fIppos\fP into the user space address starting at \fIto\fP.

On success, the number of bytes read is returned and the offset \fIppos\fP is
advanced by this number, or negative value is returned on error.
