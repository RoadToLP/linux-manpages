.SH NAME
synth_event_trace_end \- End piecewise synthetic event trace
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" synth_event_trace_end
.BI "(struct synth_event_trace_state *trace_state "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "trace_state" 12
A pointer to object tracking the piecewise trace state
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
End the trace of a synthetic event opened by
\fBsynth_event_trace__start\fP.

This function 'closes' an event trace, which basically means that
it commits the reserved event and cleans up other loose ends.

A pointer to a trace_state object is passed in, which will keep
track of the current event trace state opened with
\fBsynth_event_trace_start\fP.

Note that this function must be called after all values have been
added for each event trace, regardless of whether adding all field
values succeeded or not.
.SH "RETURN"
0 on success, err otherwise.
