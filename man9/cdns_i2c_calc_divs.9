.BI "unsigned int *b "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "f" 12
I2C clock frequency
.IP "input_clk" 12
Input clock frequency
.IP "a" 12
First divider (return value)
.IP "b" 12
Second divider (return value)
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
f is used as input and output variable. As input it is used as target I2C
frequency. On function exit f holds the actually resulting I2C frequency.
.SH "RETURN"
0 on success, negative errno otherwise.
