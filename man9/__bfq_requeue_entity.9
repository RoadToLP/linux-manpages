.SH NAME
__bfq_requeue_entity \- handle requeueing or repositioning of an entity.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" __bfq_requeue_entity
.BI "(struct bfq_entity *entity "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "entity" 12
the entity being requeued or repositioned.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Requeueing is needed if this entity stops being served, which
happens if a leaf descendant entity has expired. On the other hand,
repositioning is needed if the next_inservice_entity for the child
entity has changed. See the comments inside the function for
details.

Basically, this function: 1) removes entity from its active tree if
present there, 2) updates the timestamps of entity and 3) inserts
entity back into its active tree (in the new, right position for
the new values of the timestamps).
