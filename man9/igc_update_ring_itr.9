.SH NAME
igc_update_ring_itr \- update the dynamic ITR value based on packet size
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" igc_update_ring_itr
.BI "(struct igc_q_vector *q_vector "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "q_vector" 12
pointer to q_vector
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Stores a new ITR value based on strictly on packet size.  This
algorithm is less sophisticated than that used in igc_update_itr,
due to the difficulty of synchronizing statistics across multiple
receive rings.  The divisors and thresholds used by this function
were determined based on theoretical maximum wire speed and testing
data, in order to minimize response time while increasing bulk
throughput.
.SH "NOTE"
This function is called only when operating in a multiqueue
receive environment.
