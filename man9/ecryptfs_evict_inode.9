.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fIinode\fP - The ecryptfs inode

Called by \fBiput\fP when the inode reference count reached zero
and the inode is not hashed anywhere.  Used to clear anything
that needs to be, before the inode is completely destroyed and put
on the inode free list. We use this to drop out reference to the
lower inode.
