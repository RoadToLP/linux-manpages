.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function looks up the TNC tree and search for zero-level znode which
refers key \fIkey\fP. The found zero-level znode is returned in \fIzn\fP. There are 3
cases:
o exact match, i.e. the found zero-level znode contains key \fIkey\fP, then 1
is returned and slot number of the matched branch is stored in \fIn\fP;
o not exact match, which means that zero-level znode does not contain
\fIkey\fP, then 0 is returned and slot number of the closest branch or -1
is stored in \fIn\fP; In this case calling \fBtnc_next\fP is mandatory.
o \fIkey\fP is so small that it is even less than the lowest key of the
leftmost zero-level node, then 0 is returned and 0 is stored in \fIn\fP.

Note, when the TNC tree is traversed, some znodes may be absent, then this
function reads corresponding indexing nodes and inserts them to TNC. In
case of failure, a negative error code is returned.
