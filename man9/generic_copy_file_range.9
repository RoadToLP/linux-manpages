.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This is a generic filesystem helper to copy data from one file to another.
It has no constraints on the source or destination file owners - the files
can belong to different superblocks and different filesystem types. Short
copies are allowed.

This should be called from the \fIfile_out\fP filesystem, as per the
->\fBcopy_file_range\fP method.

Returns the number of bytes copied or a negative error indicating the
failure.
