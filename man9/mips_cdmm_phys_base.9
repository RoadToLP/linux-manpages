.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Picking a suitable physical address at which to map the CDMM region is
platform specific, so this weak function can be overridden by platform
code to pick a suitable value if none is configured by the bootloader.
By default this method tries to find a CDMM-specific node in the system
dtb. Note that this won't work for early serial console.
