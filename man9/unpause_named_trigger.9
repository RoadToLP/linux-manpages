.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" unpause_named_trigger
.BI "(struct event_trigger_data *data "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "data" 12
The trigger data of a named trigger to unpause
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Un-pauses a named trigger along with all other triggers having the
same name.  Because named triggers share a common set of data,
unpausing only one is meaningless, so unpausing one named trigger
needs to unpause all triggers with the same name.
