.SH NAME
gfs2_blk2rgrpd \- Find resource group for a given data/meta block number
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "struct gfs2_rgrpd *" gfs2_blk2rgrpd
.BI "(struct gfs2_sbd *sdp "  ","
.BI "u64 blk "  ","
.BI "bool exact "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "sdp" 12
The GFS2 superblock
.IP "blk" 12
The data block number
.IP "exact" 12
True if this needs to be an exact match
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The \fIexact\fP argument should be set to true by most callers. The exception
is when we need to match blocks which are not represented by the rgrp
bitmap, but which are part of the rgrp (i.e. padding blocks) which are
there for alignment purposes. Another way of looking at it is that \fIexact\fP
matches only valid data/metadata blocks, but with \fIexact\fP false, it will
match any block within the extent of the rgrp.
.SH "RETURN"
The resource group, or NULL if not found
