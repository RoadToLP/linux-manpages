.SH NAME
devm_hwspin_lock_request \- request an hwspinlock for a managed device
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "struct hwspinlock *" devm_hwspin_lock_request
.BI "(struct device *dev "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dev" 12
the device to request an hwspinlock
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function should be called by users of the hwspinlock device,
in order to dynamically assign them an unused hwspinlock.
Usually the user of this lock will then have to communicate the lock's id
to the remote core before it can be used for synchronization (to get the
id of a given hwlock, use \fBhwspin_lock_get_id\fP).

Should be called from a process context (might sleep)

Returns the address of the assigned hwspinlock, or NULL on error
