.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "symsize" 12
the symbol size (number of bits)
.IP "gfpoly" 12
the extended Galois field generator polynomial coefficients,
with the 0th coefficient in the low order bit. The polynomial
must be primitive;
.IP "gffunc" 12
pointer to function to generate the next field element,
or the multiplicative identity element if given 0.  Used
instead of gfpoly if gfpoly is 0
.IP "fcr" 12
the first consecutive root of the rs code generator polynomial
in index form
.IP "prim" 12
primitive element to generate polynomial roots
.IP "nroots" 12
RS code generator polynomial degree (number of roots)
.IP "gfp" 12
GFP_ flags for allocations
