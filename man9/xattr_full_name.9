.SH NAME
xattr_full_name \- Compute full attribute name from suffix
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "const char *" xattr_full_name
.BI "(const struct xattr_handler *handler "  ","
.BI "const char *name "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "handler" 12
handler of the xattr_handler operation
.IP "name" 12
name passed to the xattr_handler operation
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The get and set xattr handler operations are called with the remainder of
the attribute name after skipping the handler's prefix: for example, "foo"
is passed to the get operation of a handler with prefix "user." to get
attribute "user.foo".  The full name is still "there" in the name though.
.SH "NOTE"
the list xattr handler operation when called from the vfs is passed a
NULL name; some file systems use this operation internally, with varying
semantics.
