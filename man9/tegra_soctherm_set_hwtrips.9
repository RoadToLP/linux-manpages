.SH NAME
tegra_soctherm_set_hwtrips \- set HW trip point from DT data
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" tegra_soctherm_set_hwtrips
.BI "(struct device *dev "  ","
.BI "const struct tegra_tsensor_group *sg "  ","
.BI "struct thermal_zone_device *tz "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dev" 12
struct device * of the SOC_THERM instance
.IP "sg" 12
pointer to the sensor group to set the thermtrip temperature for
.IP "tz" 12
struct thermal_zone_device *
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Configure the SOC_THERM HW trip points, setting "THERMTRIP"
"THROTTLE" trip points , using "thermtrips", "critical" or "hot"
type trip_temp
from thermal zone.
After they have been configured, THERMTRIP or THROTTLE will take
action when the configured SoC thermal sensor group reaches a
certain temperature.
.SH "RETURN"
0 upon success, or a negative error code on failure.
"Success" does not mean that trips was enabled; it could also
mean that no node was found in DT.
THERMTRIP has been enabled successfully when a message similar to
this one appears on the serial console:
"thermtrip: will shut down when sensor group XXX reaches YYYYYY mC"
THROTTLE has been enabled successfully when a message similar to
this one appears on the serial console:
""throttrip: will throttle when sensor group XXX reaches YYYYYY mC"
