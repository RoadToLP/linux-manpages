.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Declare that a buffered read operation is about to start, and ensure
that we block all direct I/O.
On exit, the function ensures that the NFS_INO_ODIRECT flag is unset,
and holds a shared lock on inode->i_rwsem to ensure that the flag
cannot be changed.
In practice, this means that buffered read operations are allowed to
execute in parallel, thanks to the shared lock, whereas direct I/O
operations need to wait to grab an exclusive lock in order to set
NFS_INO_ODIRECT.
Note that buffered writes and truncates both take a write lock on
inode->i_rwsem, meaning that those are serialised w.r.t. the reads.
