.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "ctx" 12
context to operate on
.IP "qp" 12
queue pair to operate on
.IP "port_num" 12
port num to which the connection is bound
.IP "cqe" 12
completion queue entry for the last WR
.IP "chain_wr" 12
WR to append to the posted chain
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Return the WR chain for the set of RDMA READ/WRITE operations described by
\fIctx\fP, as well as any memory registration operations needed.  If \fIchain_wr\fP
is non-NULL the WR it points to will be appended to the chain of WRs posted.
If \fIchain_wr\fP is not set \fIcqe\fP must be set so that the caller gets a
completion notification.
