.SH NAME
regulator_map_voltage_iterate \- map_voltage() based on list_voltage()
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" regulator_map_voltage_iterate
.BI "(struct regulator_dev *rdev "  ","
.BI "int min_uV "  ","
.BI "int max_uV "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "rdev" 12
Regulator to operate on
.IP "min_uV" 12
Lower bound for voltage
.IP "max_uV" 12
Upper bound for voltage
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Drivers implementing \fBset_voltage_sel\fP and \fBlist_voltage\fP can use
this as their \fBmap_voltage\fP operation.  It will find a suitable
voltage by calling \fBlist_voltage\fP until it gets something in bounds
for the requested voltages.
