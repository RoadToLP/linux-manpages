.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" vmw_stdu_connector_destroy
.BI "(struct drm_connector *connector "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "connector" 12
used to get the containing STDU
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
vmwgfx cleans up crtc/encoder/connector all at the same time so technically
this can be a no-op.  Nevertheless, it doesn't hurt of have this in case
the common KMS code changes and somehow \fBvmw_stdu_crtc_destroy\fP doesn't
get called.
