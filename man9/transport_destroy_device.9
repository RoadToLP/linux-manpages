.SH NAME
transport_destroy_device \- destroy a removed device
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" transport_destroy_device
.BI "(struct device *dev "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dev" 12
device to eliminate from the transport class.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This call triggers the elimination of storage associated with the
transport classdev.  Note: all it really does is relinquish a
reference to the classdev.  The memory will not be freed until the
last reference goes to zero.  Note also that the classdev retains a
reference count on dev, so dev too will remain for as long as the
transport class device remains around.
