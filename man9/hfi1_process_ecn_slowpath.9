.SH NAME
hfi1_process_ecn_slowpath \- Process FECN or BECN bits
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "bool" hfi1_process_ecn_slowpath
.BI "(struct rvt_qp *qp "  ","
.BI "struct hfi1_packet *pkt "  ","
.BI "bool prescan "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "qp" 12
The packet's destination QP
.IP "pkt" 12
The packet itself.
.IP "prescan" 12
Is the caller the RXQ prescan
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Process the packet's FECN or BECN bits. By now, the packet
has already been evaluated whether processing of those bit should
be done.
The significance of the \fIprescan\fP argument is that if the caller
is the RXQ prescan, a CNP will be send out instead of waiting for the
normal packet processing to send an ACK with BECN set (or a CNP).
