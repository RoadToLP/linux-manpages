.SH NAME
__scsi_device_lookup \- find a device given the host (UNLOCKED)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "struct scsi_device *" __scsi_device_lookup
.BI "(struct Scsi_Host *shost "  ","
.BI "uint channel "  ","
.BI "uint id "  ","
.BI "u64 lun "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "shost" 12
SCSI host pointer
.IP "channel" 12
SCSI channel (zero if only one channel)
.IP "id" 12
SCSI target number (physical unit number)
.IP "lun" 12
SCSI Logical Unit Number
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Looks up the scsi_device with the specified \fIchannel\fP, \fIid\fP, \fIlun\fP
for a given host. The returned scsi_device does not have an additional
reference.  You must hold the host's host_lock over this call and any access
to the returned scsi_device.
.SH "NOTE"
The only reason why drivers would want to use this is because
they need to access the device list in irq context.  Otherwise you
really want to use scsi_device_lookup instead.
