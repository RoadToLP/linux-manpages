.SH "DESCRIPTION"
On return from this function, it is guaranteed that event checking
isn't in progress and won't happen until unblocked by
\fBdisk_unblock_events\fP.  Events blocking is counted and the actual
unblocking happens after the matching number of unblocks are done.

Note that this intentionally does not block event checking from
\fBdisk_clear_events\fP.
.SH "CONTEXT"
Might sleep.
