This function initializes the PF/SM mailbox for use.  It will split the
buffer provided and use that to populate both the Tx and Rx FIFO by
evenly splitting it.  In order to allow for easy masking of head/tail
the value reported in size must be a power of 2 and is reported in
DWORDs, not bytes.  Any invalid values will cause the mailbox to return
error.
