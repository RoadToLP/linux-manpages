.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Routine assumes that packet "bytes" long was dequeued from leaf cl
borrowing from "level". It accounts bytes to ceil leaky bucket for
leaf and all ancestors and to rate bucket for ancestors at levels
"level" and higher. It also handles possible change of mode resulting
from the update. Note that mode can also increase here (MAY_BORROW to
CAN_SEND) because we can use more precise clock that event queue here.
In such case we remove class from event queue first.
