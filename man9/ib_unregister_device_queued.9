The device to unregister
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This schedules an asynchronous unregistration using a WQ for the device. A
driver should use this to avoid holding locks while doing unregistration,
such as holding the RTNL lock.

Drivers using this API must use ib_unregister_driver before module unload
to ensure that all scheduled unregistrations have completed.
