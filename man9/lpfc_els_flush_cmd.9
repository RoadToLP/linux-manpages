pointer to a host virtual N_Port data structure.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This routine is used to clean up all the outstanding ELS commands on a
\fIvport\fP. It first aborts the \fIvport\fP by invoking \fBlpfc_fabric_abort_vport\fP
routine. After that, it walks the ELS transmit queue to remove all the
IOCBs with the \fIvport\fP other than the QUE_RING and ABORT/CLOSE IOCBs. For
the IOCBs with a non-NULL completion callback function, the callback
function will be invoked with the status set to IOSTAT_LOCAL_REJECT and
un.ulpWord[4] set to IOERR_SLI_ABORTED. For IOCBs with a NULL completion
callback function, the IOCB will simply be released. Finally, it walks
the ELS transmit completion queue to issue an abort IOCB to any transmit
completion queue IOCB that is associated with the \fIvport\fP and is not
an IOCB from libdfc (i.e., the management plane IOCBs that are not
part of the discovery state machine) out to HBA by invoking the
\fBlpfc_sli_issue_abort_iotag\fP routine. Note that this function issues the
abort IOCB to any transmit completion queueed IOCB, it does not guarantee
the IOCBs are aborted when this function returns.
