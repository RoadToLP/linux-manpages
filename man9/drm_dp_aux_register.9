.SH NAME
drm_dp_aux_register \- initialise and register aux channel
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" drm_dp_aux_register
.BI "(struct drm_dp_aux *aux "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "aux" 12
DisplayPort AUX channel
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Automatically calls \fBdrm_dp_aux_init\fP if this hasn't been done yet.
This should only be called when the underlying \fIstruct drm_connector\fP is
initialiazed already. Therefore the best place to call this is from
\fIdrm_connector_funcs.late_register\fP. Not that drivers which don't follow this
will Oops when CONFIG_DRM_DP_AUX_CHARDEV is enabled.

Drivers which need to use the aux channel before that point (e.g. at driver
load time, before \fBdrm_dev_register\fP has been called) need to call
\fBdrm_dp_aux_init\fP.

Returns 0 on success or a negative error code on failure.
