probe_irq_off \- end an interrupt autodetect
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" probe_irq_off
.BI "(unsigned long val "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "val" 12
mask of potential interrupts (unused)

Scans the unused interrupt lines and returns the line which
appears to have triggered the interrupt. If no interrupt was
found then zero is returned. If more than one interrupt is
found then minus the first candidate is returned to indicate
their is doubt.

The interrupt probe logic state is returned to its previous
value.

BUGS: When used in a module (which arguably shouldn't happen)
nothing prevents two IRQ probe callers from overlapping. The
results of this are non-optimal.
