.SH NAME
gpio_to_pin \- GPIO range GPIO number to pin number translation
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" gpio_to_pin
.BI "(struct pinctrl_gpio_range *range "  ","
.BI "unsigned int gpio "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "range" 12
GPIO range used for the translation
.IP "gpio" 12
gpio pin to translate to a pin number
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Finds the pin number for a given GPIO using the specified GPIO range
as a base for translation. The distinction between linear GPIO ranges
and pin list based GPIO ranges is managed correctly by this function.

This function assumes the gpio is part of the specified GPIO range, use
only after making sure this is the case (e.g. by calling it on the
result of successful pinctrl_get_device_gpio_range calls)!
