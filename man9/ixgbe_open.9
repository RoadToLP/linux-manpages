Returns 0 on success, negative value on failure

The open entry point is called when a network interface is made
active by the system (IFF_UP).  At this point all resources needed
for transmit and receive operations are allocated, the interrupt
handler is registered with the OS, the watchdog timer is started,
and the stack is notified that the interface is ready.
