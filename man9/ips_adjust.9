.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Wake up every 5s or so and check whether we should adjust the power clamp.
Check CPU and GPU load to determine which needs adjustment.  There are
several things to consider here:
- do we need to adjust up or down?
- is CPU busy?
- is GPU busy?
- is CPU in turbo?
- is GPU in turbo?
- is CPU or GPU preferred? (CPU is default)

So, given the above, we do the following:
- up (TDP available)
- CPU not busy, GPU not busy - nothing
- CPU busy, GPU not busy - adjust CPU up
- CPU not busy, GPU busy - adjust GPU up
- CPU busy, GPU busy - adjust preferred unit up, taking headroom from
non-preferred unit if necessary
- down (at TDP limit)
- adjust both CPU and GPU down if possible
