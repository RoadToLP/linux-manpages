hv_send_resources_allocated \- Report local resource choices
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" hv_send_resources_allocated
.BI "(struct hv_device *hdev "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "hdev" 12
VMBus's tracking struct for this root PCI bus
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The host OS is expecting to be sent a request as a message
which contains all the resources that the device will use.
The response contains those same resources, "translated"
which is to say, the values which should be used by the
hardware, when it delivers an interrupt.  (MMIO resources are
used in local terms.)  This is nice for Windows, and lines up
with the FDO/PDO split, which doesn't exist in Linux.  Linux
is deeply expecting to scan an emulated PCI configuration
space.  So this message is sent here only to drive the state
machine on the host forward.
.SH "RETURN"
0 on success, -errno on failure
