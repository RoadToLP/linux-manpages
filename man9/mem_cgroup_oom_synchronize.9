.SH NAME
mem_cgroup_oom_synchronize \- complete memcg OOM handling
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "bool" mem_cgroup_oom_synchronize
.BI "(bool handle "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "handle" 12
actually kill/wait or just clean up the OOM state
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This has to be called at the end of a page fault if the memcg OOM
handler was enabled.

Memcg supports userspace OOM handling where failed allocations must
sleep on a waitqueue until the userspace task resolves the
situation.  Sleeping directly in the charge context with all kinds
of locks held is not a good idea, instead we remember an OOM state
in the task and \fBmem_cgroup_oom_synchronize\fP has to be called at
the end of the page fault to complete the OOM handling.

Returns true if an ongoing memcg OOM situation was detected and
completed, false otherwise.
