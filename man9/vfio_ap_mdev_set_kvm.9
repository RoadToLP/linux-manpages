vfio_ap_mdev_set_kvm \- 
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" vfio_ap_mdev_set_kvm
.BI "(struct ap_matrix_mdev *matrix_mdev "  ","
.BI "struct kvm *kvm "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "matrix_mdev" 12
a mediated matrix device
.IP "kvm" 12
reference to KVM instance
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Sets all data for \fImatrix_mdev\fP that are needed to manage AP resources
for the guest whose state is represented by \fIkvm\fP.

Return 0 if no other mediated matrix device has a reference to \fIkvm\fP;
otherwise, returns an -EPERM.
.SH "NOTE"
The matrix_dev->lock must be taken prior to calling
this function; however, the lock will be temporarily released while the
guest's AP configuration is set to avoid a potential lockdep splat.
The kvm->lock is taken to set the guest's AP configuration which, under
certain circumstances, will result in a circular lock dependency if this is
done under the \fImatrix_mdev->lock\fP.
