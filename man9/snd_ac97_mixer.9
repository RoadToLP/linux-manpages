.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Creates an Codec97 component.  An struct snd_ac97 instance is newly
allocated and initialized from the template.  The codec
is then initialized by the standard procedure.

The template must include the codec number (num) and address (addr),
and the private data (private_data).

The ac97 instance is registered as a low-level device, so you don't
have to release it manually.
.SH "RETURN"
Zero if successful, or a negative error code on failure.
