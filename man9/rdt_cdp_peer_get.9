.SH NAME
rdt_cdp_peer_get \- Retrieve CDP peer if it exists
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" rdt_cdp_peer_get
.BI "(struct rdt_resource *r "  ","
.BI "struct rdt_domain *d "  ","
.BI "struct rdt_resource **r_cdp "  ","
.BI "struct rdt_domain **d_cdp "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "r" 12
RDT resource to which RDT domain \fId\fP belongs
.IP "d" 12
Cache instance for which a CDP peer is requested
.IP "r_cdp" 12
RDT resource that shares hardware with \fIr\fP (RDT resource peer)
Used to return the result.
.IP "d_cdp" 12
RDT domain that shares hardware with \fId\fP (RDT domain peer)
Used to return the result.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
RDT resources are managed independently and by extension the RDT domains
(RDT resource instances) are managed independently also. The Code and
Data Prioritization (CDP) RDT resources, while managed independently,
could refer to the same underlying hardware. For example,
RDT_RESOURCE_L2CODE and RDT_RESOURCE_L2DATA both refer to the L2 cache.

When provided with an RDT resource \fIr\fP and an instance of that RDT
resource \fId\fP \fBrdt_cdp_peer_get\fP will return if there is a peer RDT
resource and the exact instance that shares the same hardware.
.SH "RETURN"
0 if a CDP peer was found, <0 on error or if no CDP peer exists.
If a CDP peer was found, \fIr_cdp\fP will point to the peer RDT resource
and \fId_cdp\fP will point to the peer RDT domain.
