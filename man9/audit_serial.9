.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Compute a serial number for the audit record.  Audit records are
written to user-space as soon as they are generated, so a complete
audit record may be written in several pieces.  The timestamp of the
record and this serial number are used by the user-space tools to
determine which pieces belong to the same audit record.  The
(timestamp,serial) tuple is unique for each syscall and is live from
syscall entry to syscall exit.
.SH "NOTE"
Another possibility is to store the formatted records off the
audit context (for those records that have a context), and emit them
all at syscall exit.  However, this could delay the reporting of
significant errors until syscall exit (or never, if the system
halts).
