.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The End Of Frame notification sent by sensor subdev in its still capture
mode. If there is only a single VSYNC generated by the sensor at the
beginning of a frame transmission, FIMC does not issue the LastIrq
(end of frame) interrupt. And this notification is used to complete the
frame capture and returning a buffer to user-space. Subdev drivers should
call this notification from their last 'End of frame capture' interrupt.
