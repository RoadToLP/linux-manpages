.BI "(const struct pkt_gl *si "  ","

.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "si" 12
the packet gather list
.IP "q" 12
the SGE free list
.IP "frags" 12
number of FL buffers to restore

Puts back on an FL the Rx buffers associated with \fIsi\fP.  The buffers
have already been unmapped and are left unmapped, we mark them so to
prevent further unmapping attempts.

This function undoes a series of \fIunmap_rx_buf\fP calls when we find out
that the current packet can't be processed right away afterall and we
need to come back to it later.  This is a very rare event and there's
no effort to make this particularly efficient.
