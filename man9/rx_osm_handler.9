.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function is called by the Rx interrupt serivce routine to perform
some OS related operations on the SKB before passing it to the upper
layers. It mainly checks if the checksum is OK, if so adds it to the
SKBs cksum variable, increments the Rx packet count and passes the SKB
to the upper layer. If the checksum is wrong, it increments the Rx
packet error count, frees the SKB and returns error.
Return value:
SUCCESS on success and -1 on failure.
