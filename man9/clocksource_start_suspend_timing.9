.SH NAME
clocksource_start_suspend_timing \- Start measuring the suspend timing
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" clocksource_start_suspend_timing
.BI "(struct clocksource *cs "  ","
.BI "u64 start_cycles "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "cs" 12
current clocksource from timekeeping
.IP "start_cycles" 12
current cycles from timekeeping
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function will save the start cycle values of suspend timer to calculate
the suspend time when resuming system.

This function is called late in the suspend process from \fBtimekeeping_suspend\fP,
that means processes are freezed, non-boot cpus and interrupts are disabled
now. It is therefore possible to start the suspend timer without taking the
clocksource mutex.
