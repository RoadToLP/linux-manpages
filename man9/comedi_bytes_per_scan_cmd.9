COMEDI command.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Determines the overall scan length according to the subdevice type and the
number of channels in the scan for the specified command.

For digital input, output or input/output subdevices, samples for
multiple channels are assumed to be packed into one or more unsigned
short or unsigned int values according to the subdevice's SDF_LSAMPL
flag.  For other types of subdevice, samples are assumed to occupy a
whole unsigned short or unsigned int according to the SDF_LSAMPL flag.

Returns the overall scan length in bytes.
