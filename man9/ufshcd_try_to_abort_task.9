.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Abort the pending command in device by sending UFS_ABORT_TASK task management
command, and in host controller by clearing the door-bell register. There can
be race between controller sending the command to the device while abort is
issued. To avoid that, first issue UFS_QUERY_TASK to check if the command is
really issued and then try to abort it.

Returns zero on success, non-zero on failure
