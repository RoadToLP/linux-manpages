.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Remarks:
This routine is invoked by Linux to send a SCSI command to the driver.
The mid-level driver tries to ensure that queuecommand never gets
invoked concurrently with itself or the interrupt handler (although
the interrupt handler may call this routine as part of request-
completion handling).   Unfortunely, it sometimes calls the scheduler
in interrupt context which is a big NO! NO!.
