.IP "irq" 12
The interrupt number
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function must only be used for debug and testing purposes!

Especially on x86 this can cause a premature completion of an interrupt
affinity change causing the interrupt line to become stale. Very
unlikely, but possible.

The injection can fail for various reasons:
- Interrupt is not activated
- Interrupt is NMI type or currently replaying
- Interrupt is level type
- Interrupt does not support hardware retrigger and software resend is
either not enabled or not possible for the interrupt.
