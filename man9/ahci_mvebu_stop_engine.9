.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" ahci_mvebu_stop_engine
.BI "(struct ata_port *ap "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "ap" 12
Target ata port
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Errata Ref#226 - SATA Disk HOT swap issue when connected through
Port Multiplier in FIS-based Switching mode.

To avoid the issue, according to design, the bits[11:8, 0] of
register PxFBS are cleared when Port Command and Status (0x18) bit[0]
changes its value from 1 to 0, i.e. falling edge of Port
Command and Status bit[0] sends PULSE that resets PxFBS
bits[11:8; 0].

This function is used to override function of "ahci_stop_engine"
from libahci.c by adding the mvebu work around(WA) to save PxFBS
value before the PxCMD ST write of 0, then restore PxFBS value.
.SH "RETURN"
0 on success; Error code otherwise.
