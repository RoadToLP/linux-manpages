.BI "(struct lpfc_hba *phba "  ","
.BI "struct lpfc_async_xchg_ctx *axchg "  ");"

pointer to lpfc hba data structure.
.IP "axchg" 12
pointer to exchange context for the NVME LS request
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This routine is used for processing an asychronously received NVME LS
request. Any remaining validation is done and the LS is then forwarded
to the nvme-fc transport via \fBnvme_fc_rcv_ls_req\fP.

The calling sequence should be: \fBnvme_fc_rcv_ls_req\fP -> (processing)
-> lpfc_nvme_xmt_ls_rsp/cmp -> req->done.
__lpfc_nvme_xmt_ls_rsp_cmp should free the allocated axchg.

Returns 0 if LS was handled and delivered to the transport
Returns 1 if LS failed to be handled and should be dropped
