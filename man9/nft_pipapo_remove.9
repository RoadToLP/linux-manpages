.BI "const struct nft_set *set "  ","
.BI "const struct nft_set_elem *elem "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS

.IP "set" 12
nftables API set representation
.IP "elem" 12
nftables API element representation containing key data
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Similarly to \fBnft_pipapo_activate\fP, this is used as commit operation by the
API, but it's called once per element in the pending transaction, so we can't
implement this as a single commit operation. Closest we can get is to remove
the matched element here, if any, and commit the updated matching data.
