.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The bundle allocator is intended for allocations that are connected with
processing the system call related to the bundle. The allocated memory is
always freed once the system call completes, and cannot be freed any other
way.

This tries to use a small pool of pre-allocated memory for performance.
