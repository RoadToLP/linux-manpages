.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dev_priv" 12
Pointer to a device private structure.
.IP "framebuffer" 12
Pointer to the framebuffer on which to perform the actions.
.IP "clips" 12
A set of struct drm_clip_rect. Either this os \fIvclips\fP must be NULL.
Cliprects are given in framebuffer coordinates.
.IP "vclips" 12
A set of struct drm_vmw_rect cliprects. Either this or \fIclips\fP must
be NULL. Cliprects are given in source coordinates.
.IP "dest_x" 12
X coordinate offset for the crtc / destination clip rects.
.IP "dest_y" 12
Y coordinate offset for the crtc / destination clip rects.
.IP "num_clips" 12
Number of cliprects in the \fIclips\fP or \fIvclips\fP array.
.IP "increment" 12
Integer with which to increment the clip counter when looping.
Used to skip a predetermined number of clip rects.
.IP "dirty" 12
Closure structure. See the description of struct vmw_kms_dirty.
