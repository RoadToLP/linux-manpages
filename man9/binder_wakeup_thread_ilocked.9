.BI "bool sync "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS

.IP "thread" 12

.IP "sync" 12

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function wakes up a thread in the \fIproc\fP process.
The caller may provide a specific thread to wake-up in
the \fIthread\fP parameter. If \fIthread\fP is NULL, this function
will wake up threads that have called \fBpoll\fP.

Note that for this function to work as expected, callers
should first call \fBbinder_select_thread\fP to find a thread
to handle the work (if they don't have a thread already),
and pass the result into the \fIthread\fP parameter.
