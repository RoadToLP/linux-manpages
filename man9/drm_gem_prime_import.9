.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This is the implementation of the gem_prime_import functions for GEM drivers
using the PRIME helpers. Drivers can use this as their
\fIdrm_driver.gem_prime_import\fP implementation. It is used as the default
implementation in \fBdrm_gem_prime_fd_to_handle\fP.

Drivers must arrange to call \fBdrm_prime_gem_destroy\fP from their
\fIdrm_gem_object_funcs.free\fP hook when using this function.
