.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This kicks in whenever a new protocol has completed its own registration via
\fBscmi_register_protocol_events\fP: it is in charge of scanning the table of
pending handlers (registered by users while the related protocol was still
not initialized) and finalizing their initialization whenever possible;
invalid pending handlers are purged at this point in time.
