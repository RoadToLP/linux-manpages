.SH NAME
fcoe_check_wait_queue \- Attempt to clear the transmit backlog
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" fcoe_check_wait_queue
.BI "(struct fc_lport *lport "  ","
.BI "struct sk_buff *skb "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "lport" 12
The local port whose backlog is to be cleared
.IP "skb" 12
The received FIP packet
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This empties the wait_queue, dequeues the head of the wait_queue queue
and calls \fBfcoe_start_io\fP for each packet. If all skb have been
transmitted it returns the qlen. If an error occurs it restores
wait_queue (to try again later) and returns -1.

The wait_queue is used when the skb transmit fails. The failed skb
will go in the wait_queue which will be emptied by the timer function or
by the next skb transmit.
