.BI "(uint32_t * HashResultPointer "  ","
.BI "uint32_t * HashWorkingPointer "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "HashResultPointer" 12
pointer to an initial/result hash table.
.IP "HashWorkingPointer" 12
pointer to an working hash table.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This routine iterates an initial hash table pointed by \fIHashResultPointer\fP
with the values from the working hash table pointeed by \fIHashWorkingPointer\fP.
The results are putting back to the initial hash table, returned through
