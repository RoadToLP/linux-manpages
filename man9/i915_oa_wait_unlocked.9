.SH NAME
i915_oa_wait_unlocked \- handles blocking IO until OA data available
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" i915_oa_wait_unlocked
.BI "(struct i915_perf_stream *stream "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "stream" 12
An i915-perf stream opened for OA metrics
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Called when userspace tries to \fBread\fP from a blocking stream FD opened
for OA metrics. It waits until the hrtimer callback finds a non-empty
OA buffer and wakes us.
.SH "NOTE"
it's acceptable to have this return with some false positives
since any subsequent read handling will return -EAGAIN if there isn't
really data ready for userspace yet.
.SH "RETURN"
zero on success or a negative error code
