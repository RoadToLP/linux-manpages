.SH NAME
comedi_check_chanlist \- Validate each element in a chanlist.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" comedi_check_chanlist
.BI "(struct comedi_subdevice *s "  ","
.BI "int n "  ","
.BI "unsigned int *chanlist "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "s" 12
comedi_subdevice struct
.IP "n" 12
number of elements in the chanlist
.IP "chanlist" 12
the chanlist to validate
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Each element consists of a channel number, a range index, an analog
reference type and some flags, all packed into an unsigned int.

This checks that the channel number and range index are supported by
the comedi subdevice.  It does not check whether the analog reference
type and the flags are supported.  Drivers that care should check those
themselves.
.SH "RETURN"
0 if all \fIchanlist\fP elements are valid (success),
-EINVAL if one or more elements are invalid.
