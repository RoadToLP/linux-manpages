.SH NAME
acpi_dev_pm_attach \- Prepare device for ACPI power management.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" acpi_dev_pm_attach
.BI "(struct device *dev "  ","
.BI "bool power_on "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dev" 12
Device to prepare.
.IP "power_on" 12
Whether or not to power on the device.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
If \fIdev\fP has a valid ACPI handle that has a valid struct acpi_device object
attached to it, install a wakeup notification handler for the device and
add it to the general ACPI PM domain.  If \fIpower_on\fP is set, the device will
be put into the ACPI D0 state before the function returns.

This assumes that the \fIdev\fP's bus type uses generic power management callbacks
(or doesn't use any power management callbacks at all).

Callers must ensure proper synchronization of this function with power
management callbacks.
