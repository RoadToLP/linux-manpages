.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Walk the list of under-writeback pages of the address space that file
refers to, in the given range and wait for all of them.  Check error
status of the address space vs. the file->f_wb_err cursor and return it.

Since the error status of the file is advanced by this function,
callers are responsible for checking the return value and handling and/or
reporting the error.
