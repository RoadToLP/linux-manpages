.SH NAME
drm_dp_dsc_sink_line_buf_depth \- Get the line buffer depth in bits
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "u8" drm_dp_dsc_sink_line_buf_depth
.BI "(const u8 dsc_dpcd[DP_DSC_RECEIVER_CAP_SIZE] "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dsc_dpcd" 12
DSC capabilities from DPCD
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Read the DSC DPCD register to parse the line buffer depth in bits which is
number of bits of precision within the decoder line buffer supported by
the DSC sink. This is used to populate the DSC parameters in the
\fIstruct drm_dsc_config\fP by the driver.
Driver creates an infoframe using these parameters to populate
\fIstruct drm_dsc_pps_infoframe\fP. These are sent to the sink using DSC
infoframe using the helper function \fBdrm_dsc_pps_infoframe_pack\fP
.SH "RETURN"
Line buffer depth supported by DSC panel or 0 its invalid
