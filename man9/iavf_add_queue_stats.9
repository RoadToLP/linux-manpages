.SH NAME
iavf_add_queue_stats \- copy queue statistics into supplied buffer
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" iavf_add_queue_stats
.BI "(u64 **data "  ","
.BI "struct iavf_ring *ring "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "data" 12
ethtool stats buffer
.IP "ring" 12
the ring to copy
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Queue statistics must be copied while protected by
u64_stats_fetch_begin_irq, so we can't directly use iavf_add_ethtool_stats.
Assumes that queue stats are defined in iavf_gstrings_queue_stats. If the
ring pointer is null, zero out the queue stat values and update the data
pointer. Otherwise safely copy the stats from the ring into the supplied
buffer and update the data pointer when finished.

This function expects to be called while under \fBrcu_read_lock\fP.
