.SH NAME
lpfc_prep_seq \- Prep sequence for ULP processing
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "struct lpfc_iocbq *" lpfc_prep_seq
.BI "(struct lpfc_vport *vport "  ","
.BI "struct hbq_dmabuf *seq_dmabuf "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "vport" 12
Pointer to the vport on which this sequence was received
.IP "seq_dmabuf" 12
pointer to a dmabuf that describes the FC sequence
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function takes a sequence, described by a list of frames, and creates
a list of iocbq structures to describe the sequence. This iocbq list will be
used to issue to the generic unsolicited sequence handler. This routine
returns a pointer to the first iocbq in the list. If the function is unable
to allocate an iocbq then it throw out the received frames that were not
able to be described and return a pointer to the first iocbq. If unable to
allocate any iocbqs (including the first) this function will return NULL.
