.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Enable microphone detection functionality for the WM8958.  By
default simple detection which supports the detection of up to 6
buttons plus video and microphone functionality is supported.

The WM8958 has an advanced jack detection facility which is able to
support complex accessory detection, especially when used in
conjunction with external circuitry.  In order to provide maximum
flexiblity a callback is provided which allows a completely custom
detection algorithm.
