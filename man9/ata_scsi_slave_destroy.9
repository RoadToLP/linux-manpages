SCSI device to be destroyed

\fIsdev\fP is about to be destroyed for hot/warm unplugging.  If
this unplugging was initiated by libata as indicated by NULL
dev->sdev, this function doesn't have to do anything.
Otherwise, SCSI layer initiated warm-unplug is in progress.
Clear dev->sdev, schedule the device for ATA detach and invoke
EH.

LOCKING:
Defined by SCSI layer.  We don't really care.
