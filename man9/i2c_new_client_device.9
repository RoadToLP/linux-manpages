.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Create an i2c device. Binding is handled through driver model
\fBprobe\fP/\fBremove\fP methods.  A driver may be bound to this device when we
return from this function, or any later moment (e.g. maybe hotplugging will
load the driver module).  This call is not appropriate for use by mainboard
initialization logic, which usually runs during an \fBarch_initcall\fP long
before any i2c_adapter could exist.

This returns the new i2c client, which may be saved for later use with
\fBi2c_unregister_device\fP; or an ERR_PTR to describe the error.
