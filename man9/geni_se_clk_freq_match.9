.SH NAME
geni_se_clk_freq_match \- Get the matching or closest SE clock frequency
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" geni_se_clk_freq_match
.BI "(struct geni_se *se "  ","
.BI "unsigned long req_freq "  ","
.BI "unsigned int *index "  ","
.BI "unsigned long *res_freq "  ","
.BI "bool exact "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "se" 12
Pointer to the concerned serial engine.
.IP "req_freq" 12
Requested clock frequency.
.IP "index" 12
Index of the resultant frequency in the table.
.IP "res_freq" 12
Resultant frequency of the source clock.
.IP "exact" 12
Flag to indicate exact multiple requirement of the requested
frequency.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function is called by the protocol drivers to determine the best match
of the requested frequency as provided by the serial engine clock in order
to meet the performance requirements.

If we return success:
- if \fIexact\fP is true  then \fIres_freq\fP / <an_integer> == \fIreq_freq\fP
- if \fIexact\fP is false then \fIres_freq\fP / <an_integer> <= \fIreq_freq\fP
.SH "RETURN"
0 on success, standard Linux error codes on failure.
