.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The WM8350 supports the use of an ISINK together with a DCDC to
provide a power-efficient LED driver.  This function registers the
regulators and instantiates the platform device for a LED.  The
operating modes for the LED regulators must be configured using
\fBwm8350_isink_set_flash\fP, \fBwm8350_dcdc25_set_mode\fP and
\fBwm8350_dcdc_set_slot\fP prior to calling this function.
