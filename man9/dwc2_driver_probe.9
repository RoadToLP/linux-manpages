.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This routine creates the driver components required to control the device
(core, HCD, and PCD) and initializes the device. The driver components are
stored in a dwc2_hsotg structure. A reference to the dwc2_hsotg is saved
in the device private data. This allows the driver to access the dwc2_hsotg
structure on subsequent calls to driver methods for this device.
