.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This routine is the completion callback function to a Fabric Discover
(FDISC) ELS command. Since all the FDISC ELS commands are issued
single threaded, each FDISC completion callback function will reset
the discovery timer for all vports such that the timers will not get
unnecessary timeout. The function checks the FDISC IOCB status. If error
detected, the vport will be set to FC_VPORT_FAILED state. Otherwise,the
vport will set to FC_VPORT_ACTIVE state. It then checks whether the DID
assigned to the vport has been changed with the completion of the FDISC
command. If so, both RPI (Remote Port Index) and VPI (Virtual Port Index)
are unregistered from the HBA, and then the \fBlpfc_register_new_vport\fP
routine is invoked to register new vport with the HBA. Otherwise, the
\fBlpfc_do_scr_ns_plogi\fP routine is invoked to issue a PLOGI to the Name
Server for State Change Request (SCR).
