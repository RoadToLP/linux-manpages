.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "adap" 12
the adapter
.IP "q" 12
the send queue
.IP "skb" 12
the packet needing the descriptors
.IP "ndesc" 12
the number of Tx descriptors needed
.IP "qid" 12
the Tx queue number in its queue set (TXQ_OFLD or TXQ_CTRL)

Checks if the requested number of Tx descriptors is available on an
SGE send queue.  If the queue is already suspended or not enough
descriptors are available the packet is queued for later transmission.
Must be called with the Tx queue locked.

Returns 0 if enough descriptors are available, 1 if there aren't
enough descriptors and the packet has been queued, and 2 if the caller
needs to retry because there weren't enough descriptors at the
beginning of the call but some freed up in the mean time.
