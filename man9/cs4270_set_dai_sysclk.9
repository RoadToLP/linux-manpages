.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function is used to tell the codec driver what the input MCLK
frequency is.

The value of MCLK is used to determine which sample rates are supported
by the CS4270.  The ratio of MCLK / Fs must be equal to one of nine
supported values - 64, 96, 128, 192, 256, 384, 512, 768, and 1024.

This function calculates the nine ratios and determines which ones match
a standard sample rate.  If there's a match, then it is added to the list
of supported sample rates.

This function must be called by the machine driver's 'startup' function,
otherwise the list of supported sample rates will not be available in
time for ALSA.

For setups with variable MCLKs, pass 0 as 'freq' argument. This will cause
theoretically possible sample rates to be enabled. Call it again with a
proper value set one the external clock is set (most probably you would do
that from a machine's driver 'hw_param' hook.
