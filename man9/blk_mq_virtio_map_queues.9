.SH NAME
blk_mq_virtio_map_queues \- provide a default queue mapping for virtio device
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" blk_mq_virtio_map_queues
.BI "(struct blk_mq_queue_map *qmap "  ","
.BI "struct virtio_device *vdev "  ","
.BI "int first_vec "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "qmap" 12
CPU to hardware queue map.
.IP "vdev" 12
virtio device to provide a mapping for.
.IP "first_vec" 12
first interrupt vectors to use for queues (usually 0)
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function assumes the virtio device \fIvdev\fP has at least as many available
interrupt vectors as \fIset\fP has queues.  It will then query the vector
corresponding to each queue for it's affinity mask and built queue mapping
that maps a queue to the CPUs that have irq affinity for the corresponding
vector.
