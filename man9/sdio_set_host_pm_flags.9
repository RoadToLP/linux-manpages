Power Management flags to set

Set a capability bitmask corresponding to wanted host controller
power management features for the upcoming suspend state.
This must be called, if needed, each time the suspend method of
the function driver is called, and must contain only bits that
were returned by \fBsdio_get_host_pm_caps\fP.
The host doesn't need to be claimed, nor the function active,
for this information to be set.
