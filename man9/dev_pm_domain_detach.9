.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This functions will reverse the actions from \fBdev_pm_domain_attach\fP and
\fBdev_pm_domain_attach_by_id\fP, thus it detaches \fIdev\fP from its PM domain.
Typically it should be invoked during the remove phase, either from
subsystem level code or from drivers.

Callers must ensure proper synchronization of this function with power
management callbacks.
