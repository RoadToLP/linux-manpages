DMA channel
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Synchronizing callback execution ensures that all previously issued
transfers have completed and all associated callbacks have been called and
have returned.

This function waits for the DMA channel to stop. It assumes it has been
paused by a previous call to \fBdmaengine_terminate_async\fP, and that no new
pending descriptors have been issued with \fBdma_async_issue_pending\fP. The
behaviour is undefined otherwise.
