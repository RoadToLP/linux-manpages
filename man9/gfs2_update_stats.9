.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fIdelta\fP is the difference between the current rtt sample and the
running average srtt. We add 1/8 of that to the srtt in order to
update the current srtt estimate. The variance estimate is a bit
more complicated. We subtract the current variance estimate from
the abs value of the \fIdelta\fP and add 1/4 of that to the running
total.  That's equivalent to 3/4 of the current variance
estimate plus 1/4 of the abs of \fIdelta\fP.

Note that the index points at the array entry containing the smoothed
mean value, and the variance is always in the following entry

All times are in units of integer nanoseconds. Unlike the TCP/IP case,
they are not scaled fixed point.
