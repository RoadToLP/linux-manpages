.SH NAME
lpfc_wqe_bpl2sgl \- Convert the bpl/bde to a sgl.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "uint16_t" lpfc_wqe_bpl2sgl
.BI "(struct lpfc_hba *phba "  ","
.BI "struct lpfc_iocbq *pwqeq "  ","
.BI "struct lpfc_sglq *sglq "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "phba" 12
Pointer to HBA context object.
.IP "pwqeq" 12
Pointer to command WQE.
.IP "sglq" 12
Pointer to the scatter gather queue object.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This routine converts the bpl or bde that is in the WQE
to a sgl list for the sli4 hardware. The physical address
of the bpl/bde is converted back to a virtual address.
If the WQE contains a BPL then the list of BDE's is
converted to sli4_sge's. If the WQE contains a single
BDE then it is converted to a single sli_sge.
The WQE is still in cpu endianness so the contents of
the bpl can be used without byte swapping.

Returns valid XRI = Success, NO_XRI = Failure.
