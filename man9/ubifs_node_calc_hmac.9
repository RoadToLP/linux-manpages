.SH NAME
ubifs_node_calc_hmac \- calculate the HMAC of a UBIFS node
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" ubifs_node_calc_hmac
.BI "(const struct ubifs_info *c "  ","
.BI "const void *node "  ","
.BI "int len "  ","
.BI "int ofs_hmac "  ","
.BI "void *hmac "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "c" 12
UBIFS file-system description object
.IP "node" 12
the node to insert a HMAC into.
.IP "len" 12
the length of the node
.IP "ofs_hmac" 12
the offset in the node where the HMAC is inserted
.IP "hmac" 12
returned HMAC
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function calculates a HMAC of a UBIFS node. The HMAC is expected to be
embedded into the node, so this area is not covered by the HMAC. Also not
covered is the UBIFS_NODE_MAGIC and the CRC of the node.
