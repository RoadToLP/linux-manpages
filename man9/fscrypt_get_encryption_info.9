.SH NAME
fscrypt_get_encryption_info \- set up an inode's encryption key
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" fscrypt_get_encryption_info
.BI "(struct inode *inode "  ","
.BI "bool allow_unsupported "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "inode" 12
the inode to set up the key for.  Must be encrypted.
.IP "allow_unsupported" 12
if true, treat an unsupported encryption policy (or
unrecognized encryption context) the same way as the key
being unavailable, instead of returning an error.  Use
false unless the operation being performed is needed in
order for files (or directories) to be deleted.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Set up ->i_crypt_info, if it hasn't already been done.
.SH "NOTE"
unless ->i_crypt_info is already set, this isn't GFP_NOFS-safe.  So
generally this shouldn't be called from within a filesystem transaction.
.SH "RETURN"
0 if ->i_crypt_info was set or was already set, *or* if the
encryption key is unavailable.  (Use \fBfscrypt_has_encryption_key\fP to
distinguish these cases.)  Also can return another -errno code.
