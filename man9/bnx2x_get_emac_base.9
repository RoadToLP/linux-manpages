This function selects the MDC/MDIO access (through emac0 or
emac1) depend on the mdc_mdio_access, port, port swapped. Each
phy has a default access mode, which could also be overridden
by nvram configuration. This parameter, whether this is the
default phy configuration, or the nvram overrun
configuration, is passed here as mdc_mdio_access and selects
the emac_base for the CL45 read/writes operations
