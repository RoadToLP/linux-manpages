perpcu_ref to resurrect
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Modify \fIref\fP so that it's in the same state as before \fBpercpu_ref_kill\fP was
called. \fIref\fP must be dead but must not yet have exited.

If \fIref\fP->\fBrelease\fP frees \fIref\fP then the caller is responsible for
guaranteeing that \fIref\fP->\fBrelease\fP does not get called while this
function is in progress.

Note that percpu_ref_tryget[_live]() are safe to perform on \fIref\fP while
this function is in progress.
