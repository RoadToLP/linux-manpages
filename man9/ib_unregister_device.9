.SH NAME
ib_unregister_device \- Unregister an IB device
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" ib_unregister_device
.BI "(struct ib_device *ib_dev "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "ib_dev" 12
The device to unregister
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Unregister an IB device.  All clients will receive a remove callback.

Callers should call this routine only once, and protect against races with
registration. Typically it should only be called as part of a remove
callback in an implementation of driver core's struct device_driver and
related.

If ops.dealloc_driver is used then ib_dev will be freed upon return from
this function.
