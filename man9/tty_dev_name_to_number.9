pointer to dev_t that this function will populate

This function converts device names like ttyS0 or ttyUSB1 into dev_t
like (4, 64) or (188, 1). If no corresponding driver is registered then
the function returns -ENODEV.

Locking: this acquires tty_mutex to protect the tty_drivers list from
being modified while we are traversing it, and makes sure to
release it before exiting.
