.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function creates a new PTP clock device. It only creates one if we
don't already have one, so it is safe to call. Will return error if it
can't create one, but success if we already have a device. Should be used
by i40e_ptp_init to create clock initially, and prevent global resets from
creating new clock devices.
