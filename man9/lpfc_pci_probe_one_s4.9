.SH NAME
lpfc_pci_probe_one_s4 \- PCI probe func to reg SLI-4 device to PCI subsys
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" lpfc_pci_probe_one_s4
.BI "(struct pci_dev *pdev "  ","
.BI "const struct pci_device_id *pid "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "pdev" 12
pointer to PCI device
.IP "pid" 12
pointer to PCI device identifier
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This routine is called from the kernel's PCI subsystem to device with
SLI-4 interface spec. When an Emulex HBA with SLI-4 interface spec is
presented on PCI bus, the kernel PCI subsystem looks at PCI device-specific
information of the device and driver to see if the driver state that it
can support this kind of device. If the match is successful, the driver
core invokes this routine. If this routine determines it can claim the HBA,
it does all the initialization that it needs to do to handle the HBA
properly.

Return code
0 - driver can claim the device
negative value - driver can not claim the device
