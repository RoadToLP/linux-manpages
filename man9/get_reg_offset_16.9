.SH NAME
get_reg_offset_16 \- Obtain offset of register indicated by instruction
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" get_reg_offset_16
.BI "(struct insn *insn "  ","
.BI "struct pt_regs *regs "  ","
.BI "int *offs1 "  ","
.BI "int *offs2 "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "insn" 12
Instruction containing ModRM byte
.IP "regs" 12
Register values as seen when entering kernel mode
.IP "offs1" 12
Offset of the first operand register
.IP "offs2" 12
Offset of the second opeand register, if applicable
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Obtain the offset, in pt_regs, of the registers indicated by the ModRM byte
in \fIinsn\fP. This function is to be used with 16-bit address encodings. The
\fIoffs1\fP and \fIoffs2\fP will be written with the offset of the two registers
indicated by the instruction. In cases where any of the registers is not
referenced by the instruction, the value will be set to -EDOM.

0 on success, -EINVAL on error.
