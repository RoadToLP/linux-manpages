SMP2P information
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This is called either when the modem has requested it (by triggering
the modem clock query IPA interrupt) or whenever the AP is shutting down
(via a panic notifier).  It sets the two SMP2P state bits--one saying
whether the IPA clock is running, and the other indicating the first bit
is valid.
