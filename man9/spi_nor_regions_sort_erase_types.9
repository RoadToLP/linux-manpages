.SH NAME
spi_nor_regions_sort_erase_types \- sort erase types in each region
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" spi_nor_regions_sort_erase_types
.BI "(struct spi_nor_erase_map *map "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "map" 12
the erase map of the SPI NOR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Function assumes that the erase types defined in the erase map are already
sorted in ascending order, with the smallest erase type size being the first
member in the erase_type array. It replicates the sort done for the map's
erase types. Each region's erase bitmask will indicate which erase types are
supported from the sorted erase types defined in the erase map.
Sort the all region's erase type at init in order to speed up the process of
finding the best erase command at runtime.
