pointer to the HW structure

During S0 to Sx transition, it is possible the link remains at gig
instead of negotiating to a lower speed.  Before going to Sx, set
'Gig Disable' to force link speed negotiation to a lower speed based on
the LPLU setting in the NVM or custom setting.  For PCH and newer parts,
the OEM bits PHY register (LED, GbE disable and LPLU configurations) also
needs to be written.
Parts that support (and are linked to a partner which support) EEE in
100Mbps should disable LPLU since 100Mbps w/ EEE requires less power
than 10Mbps w/o EEE.
