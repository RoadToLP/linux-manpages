.SH NAME
_enable_sysc \- try to bring a module out of idle via OCP_SYSCONFIG
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" _enable_sysc
.BI "(struct omap_hwmod *oh "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "oh" 12
struct omap_hwmod *
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Ensure that the OCP_SYSCONFIG register for the IP block represented
by \fIoh\fP is set to indicate to the PRCM that the IP block is active.
Usually this means placing the module into smart-idle mode and
smart-standby, but if there is a bug in the automatic idle handling
for the IP block, it may need to be placed into the force-idle or
no-idle variants of these modes.  No return value.
