.SH NAME
intel_power_domains_init_hw \- initialize hardware power domain state
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" intel_power_domains_init_hw
.BI "(struct drm_i915_private *i915 "  ","
.BI "bool resume "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "i915" 12
i915 device instance
.IP "resume" 12
Called from resume code paths or not
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function initializes the hardware power domain state and enables all
power wells belonging to the INIT power domain. Power wells in other
domains (and not in the INIT domain) are referenced or disabled by
\fBintel_modeset_readout_hw_state\fP. After that the reference count of each
power well must match its HW enabled state, see
\fBintel_power_domains_verify_state\fP.

It will return with power domains disabled (to be enabled later by
\fBintel_power_domains_enable\fP) and must be paired with
\fBintel_power_domains_driver_remove\fP.
