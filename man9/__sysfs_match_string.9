.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Returns index of \fIstr\fP in the \fIarray\fP or -EINVAL, just like \fBmatch_string\fP.
Uses sysfs_streq instead of strcmp for matching.

This routine will look for a string in an array of strings up to the
n-th element in the array or until the first NULL element.

Historically the value of -1 for \fIn\fP, was used to search in arrays that
are NULL terminated. However, the function does not make a distinction
when finishing the search: either \fIn\fP elements have been compared OR
the first NULL element was found.
