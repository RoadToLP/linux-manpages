.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "inode" 12
the inode to open

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
After atomic_open, this function is only used for opening files
which are already cached. We must still get the glock for regular
files to ensure that we have the file size uptodate for the large
file check which is in the common code. That is only an issue for
regular files though.
.SH "RETURN"
errno
