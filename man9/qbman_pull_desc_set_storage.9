.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "d" 12
the pull dequeue descriptor to be set
.IP "storage" 12
the pointer of the memory to store the dequeue result
.IP "storage_phys" 12
the physical address of the storage memory
.IP "stash" 12
to indicate whether write allocate is enabled
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
If not called, or if called with 'storage' as NULL, the result pull dequeues
will produce results to DQRR. If 'storage' is non-NULL, then results are
produced to the given memory location (using the DMA address which
the caller provides in 'storage_phys'), and 'stash' controls whether or not
those writes to main-memory express a cache-warming attribute.
