.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function receives a user data buffer to be transmitted and received on
the same port, the link must be up and in loopback mode prior
to being called.
1. A kernel buffer is allocated to copy the user data into.
2. The port registers with "itself".
3. The transmit and receive exchange ids are obtained.
4. The receive exchange id is posted.
5. A new els loopback event is created.
6. The command and response iocbs are allocated.
7. The cmd iocb FsType is set to elx loopback and the CmdRsp to looppback.

This function is meant to be called n times while the port is in loopback
so it is the apps responsibility to issue a reset to take the port out
of loopback mode.
