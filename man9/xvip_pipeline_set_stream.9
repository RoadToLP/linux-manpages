.SH NAME
xvip_pipeline_set_stream \- Enable/disable streaming on a pipeline
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" xvip_pipeline_set_stream
.BI "(struct xvip_pipeline *pipe "  ","
.BI "bool on "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "pipe" 12
The pipeline
.IP "on" 12
Turn the stream on when true or off when false
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The pipeline is shared between all DMA engines connect at its input and
output. While the stream state of DMA engines can be controlled
independently, pipelines have a shared stream state that enable or disable
all entities in the pipeline. For this reason the pipeline uses a streaming
counter that tracks the number of DMA engines that have requested the stream
to be enabled.

When called with the \fIon\fP argument set to true, this function will increment
the pipeline streaming count. If the streaming count reaches the number of
DMA engines in the pipeline it will enable all entities that belong to the
pipeline.

Similarly, when called with the \fIon\fP argument set to false, this function will
decrement the pipeline streaming count and disable all entities in the
pipeline when the streaming count reaches zero.
.SH "RETURN"
0 if successful, or the return value of the failed video::s_stream
operation otherwise. Stopping the pipeline never fails. The pipeline state is
not updated when the operation fails.
