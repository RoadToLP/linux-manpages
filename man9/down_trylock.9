.SH NAME
down_trylock \- try to acquire the semaphore, without waiting
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" down_trylock
.BI "(struct semaphore *sem "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "sem" 12
the semaphore to be acquired
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Try to acquire the semaphore atomically.  Returns 0 if the semaphore has
been acquired successfully or 1 if it cannot be acquired.

Unlike mutex_trylock, this function can be used from interrupt context,
and the semaphore can be released by any task or interrupt.
.SH "NOTE"
This return value is inverted from both spin_trylock and
mutex_trylock!  Be careful about this when converting code.
