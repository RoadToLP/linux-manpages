.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The data will be returned in the pointer at *result, if provided, and the
caller is responsible for freeing it.

The description should be of the form "[<query_type>:]<domain_name>", and
the options need to be appropriate for the query type requested.  If no
query_type is given, then the query is a straight hostname to IP address
lookup.

The DNS resolution lookup is performed by upcalling to userspace by way of
requesting a key of type dns_resolver.

Returns the size of the result on success, -ve error code otherwise.
