.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The DMADISABLE bit is a semi-automatic bit present in sysconfig register
of some modules. When the DMA must perform read/write accesses, the
DMADISABLE bit is cleared by the hardware. But when the DMA must stop
for power management, software must set the DMADISABLE bit back to 1.

Set the DMADISABLE bit in \fIv\fP for hwmod \fIoh\fP.  Returns -EINVAL upon
error or 0 upon success.
