.SH NAME
check_ring_tx_db \- check and potentially ring a Tx queue's doorbell
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" check_ring_tx_db
.BI "(struct adapter *adap "  ","
.BI "struct sge_txq *q "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "adap" 12
the adapter
.IP "q" 12
the Tx queue

Ring the doorbel if a Tx queue is asleep.  There is a natural race,
where the HW is going to sleep just after we checked, however,
then the interrupt handler will detect the outstanding TX packet
and ring the doorbell for us.

When GTS is disabled we unconditionally ring the doorbell.
