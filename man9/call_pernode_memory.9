.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBefi_memmap_walk\fP knows nothing about layout of memory across nodes. Find
out to which node a block of memory belongs.  Ignore memory that we cannot
identify, and split blocks that run across multiple nodes.

Take this opportunity to round the start address up and the end address
down to page boundaries.
