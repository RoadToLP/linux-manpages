.SH "DESCRIPTION"

When PT_SEIZED, it's used for both group stop and explicit
SEIZE/INTERRUPT traps.  Both generate PTRACE_EVENT_STOP trap with
accompanying siginfo.  If stopped, lower eight bits of exit_code contain
the stop signal; otherwise, SIGTRAP.

When !PT_SEIZED, it's used only for group stop trap with stop signal
number as exit_code and no siginfo.
.SH "CONTEXT"
Must be called with \fIcurrent->sighand->siglock\fP held, which may be
released and re-acquired before returning with intervening sleep.
