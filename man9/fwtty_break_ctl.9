.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Signals the remote to start or stop generating simulated breaks.
First, stop dequeueing from the fifo and wait for writer/drain to leave tx
before signalling the break line status. This guarantees any pending rx will
be queued to the line discipline before break is simulated on the remote.
Conversely, turning off break_ctl requires signalling the line status change,
then enabling tx.
