.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Perform initialization that requires issuing immediate commands on
the command TX endpoint.  If the modem is doing GSI firmware load
and initialization, this function will be called when an SMP2P
interrupt has been signaled by the modem.  Otherwise it will be
called from \fBipa_probe\fP after GSI firmware has been successfully
loaded, authenticated, and started by Trust Zone.
