Pointer to ATA port to perform SCSI hotplug on

Perform SCSI part of hotplug.  It's executed from a separate
workqueue after EH completes.  This is necessary because SCSI
hot plugging requires working EH and hot unplugging is
synchronized with hot plugging with a mutex.

Kernel thread context (may sleep).
