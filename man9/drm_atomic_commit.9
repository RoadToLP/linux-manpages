.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Note that this function can return -EDEADLK if the driver needed to acquire
more locks but encountered a deadlock. The caller must then do the usual w/w
backoff dance and restart. All other errors are fatal.

This function will take its own reference on \fIstate\fP.
Callers should always release their reference with \fBdrm_atomic_state_put\fP.
.SH "RETURN"
0 on success, negative error code on failure.
