ACPI device object corresponding to \fIec\fP.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Install a handler for the EC address space type unless it has been installed
already.  If \fIdevice\fP is not NULL, also look for EC query methods in the
namespace and register them, and install an event (either GPE or GPIO IRQ)
handler for the EC, if possible.
.SH "RETURN"
-ENODEV if the address space handler cannot be installed, which means
"unable to handle transactions",
-EPROBE_DEFER if GPIO IRQ acquisition needs to be deferred,
or 0 (success) otherwise.
