.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" freezer_fork
.BI "(struct task_struct *task "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS

a task which has just been forked
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fItask\fP has just been created and should conform to the current state of
the cgroup_freezer it belongs to.  This function may race against
\fBfreezer_attach\fP.  Losing to \fBfreezer_attach\fP means that we don't have
to do anything as \fBfreezer_attach\fP will put \fItask\fP into the appropriate
state.
