.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This is called from \fBrvt_do_send\fP to forward a WQE addressed to the same HFI
Note that although we are single threaded due to the send engine, we still
have to protect against \fBpost_send\fP.  We don't have to worry about
receive interrupts since this is a connected protocol and all packets
will pass through here.
