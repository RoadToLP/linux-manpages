.SH NAME
ide_write_setting \- read an IDE setting
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" ide_write_setting
.BI "(ide_drive_t *drive "  ","
.BI "const struct ide_proc_devset *setting "  ","
.BI "int val "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "drive" 12
drive to read from
.IP "setting" 12
drive setting
.IP "val" 12
value

Write a drive setting if it is possible. The caller
must hold the ide_setting_mtx when making this call.

BUGS: the data return and error are the same return value
so an error -EINVAL and true return of the same value cannot
be told apart

FIXME:  This should be changed to enqueue a special request
to the driver to change settings, and then wait on a sema for completion.
The current scheme of polling is kludgy, though safe enough.
