and whine about it.  When only the port part is specified
(e.g. 1:), the limit applies to all links connected to both
the host link and all fan-out ports connected via PMP.  If the
device part is specified as 0 (e.g. 1.00:), it specifies the
first fan-out link not the host link.  Device number 15 always
points to the host link whether PMP is attached or not.  If the
controller has slave link, device number 16 points to it.
