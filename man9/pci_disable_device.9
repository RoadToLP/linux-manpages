PCI device to be disabled
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Signal to the system that the PCI device is not in use by the system
anymore.  This only involves disabling PCI bus-mastering, if active.

Note we don't actually disable the device until all callers of
\fBpci_enable_device\fP have called \fBpci_disable_device\fP.
