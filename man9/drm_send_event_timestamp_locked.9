.SH NAME
drm_send_event_timestamp_locked \- send DRM event to file descriptor
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" drm_send_event_timestamp_locked
.BI "(struct drm_device *dev "  ","
.BI "struct drm_pending_event *e "  ","
.BI "ktime_t timestamp "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dev" 12
DRM device
.IP "e" 12
DRM event to deliver
.IP "timestamp" 12
timestamp to set for the fence event in kernel's CLOCK_MONOTONIC
time domain
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function sends the event \fIe\fP, initialized with \fBdrm_event_reserve_init\fP,
to its associated userspace DRM file. Callers must already hold
\fIdrm_device.event_lock\fP.

Note that the core will take care of unlinking and disarming events when the
corresponding DRM file is closed. Drivers need not worry about whether the
DRM file for this event still exists and can call this function upon
completion of the asynchronous work unconditionally.
