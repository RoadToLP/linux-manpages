.SH NAME
uart_get_baud_rate \- return baud rate for a particular port
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "unsigned int" uart_get_baud_rate
.BI "(struct uart_port *port "  ","
.BI "struct ktermios *termios "  ","
.BI "struct ktermios *old "  ","
.BI "unsigned int min "  ","
.BI "unsigned int max "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "port" 12
uart_port structure describing the port in question.
.IP "termios" 12
desired termios settings.
.IP "old" 12
old termios (or NULL)
.IP "min" 12
minimum acceptable baud rate
.IP "max" 12
maximum acceptable baud rate

Decode the termios structure into a numeric baud rate,
taking account of the magic 38400 baud rate (with spd_*
flags), and mapping the B0 rate to 9600 baud.

If the new baud rate is invalid, try the old termios setting.
If it's still invalid, we try 9600 baud.

Update the \fItermios\fP structure to reflect the baud rate
we're actually going to be using. Don't do this for the case
where B0 is requested ("hang up").
