Set the next power state \fIpwrst\fP that memory bank \fIbank\fP of the
powerdomain \fIpwrdm\fP will enter when the powerdomain enters the
RETENTION state.  Bank will be a number from 0 to 3, and represents
different types of memory, depending on the powerdomain.  \fIpwrst\fP
will be either RETENTION or OFF, if supported.  Returns -EINVAL if
the powerdomain pointer is null or the target power state is not
not supported for this memory bank, -EEXIST if the target memory
bank does not exist or is not controllable, or returns 0 upon
success.
