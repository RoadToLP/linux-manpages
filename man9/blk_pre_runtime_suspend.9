.SH NAME
blk_pre_runtime_suspend \- Pre runtime suspend check
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" blk_pre_runtime_suspend
.BI "(struct request_queue *q "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "q" 12
the queue of the device
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function will check if runtime suspend is allowed for the device
by examining if there are any requests pending in the queue. If there
are requests pending, the device can not be runtime suspended; otherwise,
the queue's status will be updated to SUSPENDING and the driver can
proceed to suspend the device.

For the not allowed case, we mark last busy for the device so that
runtime PM core will try to autosuspend it some time later.

This function should be called near the start of the device's
runtime_suspend callback.
.SH "RETURN"
0         - OK to runtime suspend the device
-EBUSY    - Device should not be runtime suspended
