.SH NAME
usb_autoresume_device \- immediately autoresume a USB device and its interfaces
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" usb_autoresume_device
.BI "(struct usb_device *udev "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "udev" 12
the usb_device to autoresume
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This routine should be called when a core subsystem wants to use \fIudev\fP
and needs to guarantee that it is not suspended.  No autosuspend will
occur until \fBusb_autosuspend_device\fP is called.  (Note that this will
not prevent suspend events originating in the PM core.)  Examples would
be when \fIudev\fP's device file in usbfs is opened or when a remote-wakeup
request is received.

\fIudev\fP's usage counter is incremented to prevent subsequent autosuspends.
However if the autoresume fails then the usage counter is re-decremented.

The caller must hold \fIudev\fP's device lock.

This routine can run only in process context.
.SH "RETURN"
0 on success. A negative error code otherwise.
