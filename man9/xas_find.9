.TH "xas_find" 9 "xas_find" "May 2021" "Kernel Hacker's Manual" LINUX
.SH NAME
xas_find \- Find the next present entry in the XArray.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void *" xas_find
.BI "(struct xa_state *xas "  ","
.BI "unsigned long max "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "xas" 12
XArray operation state.
.IP "max" 12
Highest index to return.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
If the \fIxas\fP has not yet been walked to an entry, return the entry
which has an index >= xas.xa_index.  If it has been walked, the entry
currently being pointed at has been processed, and so we move to the
next entry.

If no entry is found and the array is smaller than \fImax\fP, the iterator
is set to the smallest index not yet in the array.  This allows \fIxas\fP
to be immediately passed to \fBxas_store\fP.
.SH "RETURN"
The entry, if found, otherwise NULL.
