.SH NAME
call_srcu \- Queue a callback for invocation after an SRCU grace period
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" call_srcu
.BI "(struct srcu_struct *ssp "  ","
.BI "struct rcu_head *rhp "  ","
.BI "rcu_callback_t func "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "ssp" 12
srcu_struct in queue the callback
.IP "rhp" 12
structure to be used for queueing the SRCU callback.
.IP "func" 12
function to be invoked after the SRCU grace period
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The callback function will be invoked some time after a full SRCU
grace period elapses, in other words after all pre-existing SRCU
read-side critical sections have completed.  However, the callback
function might well execute concurrently with other SRCU read-side
critical sections that started after \fBcall_srcu\fP was invoked.  SRCU
read-side critical sections are delimited by \fBsrcu_read_lock\fP and
\fBsrcu_read_unlock\fP, and may be nested.

The callback will be invoked from process context, but must nevertheless
be fast and must not block.
