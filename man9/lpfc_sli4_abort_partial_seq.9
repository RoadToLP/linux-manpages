.SH NAME
lpfc_sli4_abort_partial_seq \- Abort partially assembled unsol sequence
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "bool" lpfc_sli4_abort_partial_seq
.BI "(struct lpfc_vport *vport "  ","
.BI "struct hbq_dmabuf *dmabuf "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "vport" 12
pointer to a vitural port
.IP "dmabuf" 12
pointer to a dmabuf that describes the FC sequence
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function tries to abort from the partially assembed sequence, described
by the information from basic abbort \fIdmabuf\fP. It checks to see whether such
partially assembled sequence held by the driver. If so, it shall free up all
the frames from the partially assembled sequence.

Return
true  -- if there is matching partially assembled sequence present and all
the frames freed with the sequence;
false -- if there is no matching partially assembled sequence present so
nothing got aborted in the lower layer driver
