.SH NAME
netif_setup_tc \- Handle tc mappings on real_num_tx_queues change
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" netif_setup_tc
.BI "(struct net_device *dev "  ","
.BI "unsigned int txq "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dev" 12
Network device
.IP "txq" 12
number of queues available
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
If real_num_tx_queues is changed the tc mappings may no longer be
valid. To resolve this verify the tc mapping remains valid and if
not NULL the mapping. With no priorities mapping to this
offset/count pair it will no longer be used. In the worst case TC0
is invalid nothing can be done so disable priority mappings. If is
expected that drivers will fix this mapping if they can before
calling netif_set_real_num_tx_queues.
