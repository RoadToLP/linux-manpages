.SH NAME
lpfc_els_free_iocb \- Free a command iocb and its associated resources
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" lpfc_els_free_iocb
.BI "(struct lpfc_hba *phba "  ","
.BI "struct lpfc_iocbq *elsiocb "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "phba" 12
pointer to lpfc hba data structure.
.IP "elsiocb" 12
pointer to lpfc els command iocb data structure.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This routine frees a command IOCB and its associated resources. The
command IOCB data structure contains the reference to various associated
resources, these fields must be set to NULL if the associated reference
not present:
context1 - reference to ndlp
context2 - reference to cmd
context2->next - reference to rsp
context3 - reference to bpl

It first properly decrements the reference count held on ndlp for the
IOCB completion callback function. If LPFC_DELAY_MEM_FREE flag is not
set, it invokes the \fBlpfc_els_free_data\fP routine to release the Direct
Memory Access (DMA) buffers associated with the IOCB. Otherwise, it
adds the DMA buffer the \fIphba\fP data structure for the delayed release.
If reference to the Buffer Pointer List (BPL) is present, the
\fBlpfc_els_free_bpl\fP routine is invoked to release the DMA memory
associated with BPL. Finally, the \fBlpfc_sli_release_iocbq\fP routine is
invoked to release the IOCB data structure back to \fIphba\fP IOCBQ list.

Return code
0 - Success (currently, always return 0)
