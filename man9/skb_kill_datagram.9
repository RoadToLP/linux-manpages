skb_kill_datagram \- Free a datagram skbuff forcibly
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" skb_kill_datagram
.BI "(struct sock *sk "  ","
.BI "struct sk_buff *skb "  ","
.BI "unsigned int flags "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "sk" 12
socket
.IP "skb" 12
datagram skbuff
.IP "flags" 12
MSG\_ flags

This function frees a datagram skbuff that was received by
skb_recv_datagram.  The flags argument must match the one
used for skb_recv_datagram.

If the MSG_PEEK flag is set, and the packet is still on the
receive queue of the socket, it will be taken off the queue
before it is freed.

This function currently only disables BH when acquiring the
sk_receive_queue lock.  Therefore it must not be used in a
context where that lock is acquired in an IRQ context.

It returns 0 if the packet was removed by us.
