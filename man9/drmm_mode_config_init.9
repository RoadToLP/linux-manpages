.SH NAME
drmm_mode_config_init \- managed DRM mode_configuration structure initialization
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" drmm_mode_config_init
.BI "(struct drm_device *dev "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dev" 12
DRM device
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Initialize \fIdev\fP's mode_config structure, used for tracking the graphics
configuration of \fIdev\fP.

Since this initializes the modeset locks, no locking is possible. Which is no
problem, since this should happen single threaded at init time. It is the
driver's problem to ensure this guarantee.

Cleanup is automatically handled through registering drm_mode_config_cleanup
with \fBdrmm_add_action\fP.
.SH "RETURN"
0 on success, negative error value on failure.
