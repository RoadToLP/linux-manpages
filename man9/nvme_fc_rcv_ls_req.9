.SH NAME
nvme_fc_rcv_ls_req \- transport entry point called by an LLDD upon the reception of a NVME LS request.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" nvme_fc_rcv_ls_req
.BI "(struct nvme_fc_remote_port *portptr "  ","
.BI "struct nvmefc_ls_rsp *lsrsp "  ","
.BI "void *lsreqbuf "  ","
.BI "u32 lsreqbuf_len "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "portptr" 12
-- undescribed --
.IP "lsrsp" 12
pointer to a nvmefc_ls_rsp response structure to be
used to reference the exchange corresponding to the LS
when issuing an ls response.
.IP "lsreqbuf" 12
pointer to the buffer containing the LS Request
.IP "lsreqbuf_len" 12
length, in bytes, of the received LS request
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

The nvme-fc layer will copy payload to an internal structure for
processing.  As such, upon completion of the routine, the LLDD may
immediately free/reuse the LS request buffer passed in the call.

If this routine returns error, the LLDD should abort the exchange.
