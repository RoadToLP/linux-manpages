.SH NAME
hsi_async \- Submit an HSI transfer to the controller
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" hsi_async
.BI "(struct hsi_client *cl "  ","
.BI "struct hsi_msg *msg "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "cl" 12
HSI client sending the transfer
.IP "msg" 12
The HSI transfer passed to controller
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The HSI message must have the channel, ttype, complete and destructor
fields set beforehand. If nents > 0 then the client has to initialize
also the scatterlists to point to the buffers to write to or read from.

HSI controllers relay on pre-allocated buffers from their clients and they
do not allocate buffers on their own.

Once the HSI message transfer finishes, the HSI controller calls the
complete callback with the status and actual_len fields of the HSI message
updated. The complete callback can be called before returning from
hsi_async.

Returns -errno on failure or 0 on success
