.SH NAME
s3c2410_iotiming_get \- Get the timing information from current registers.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" s3c2410_iotiming_get
.BI "(struct s3c_cpufreq_config *cfg "  ","
.BI "struct s3c_iotimings *timings "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "cfg" 12
The frequency configuration
.IP "timings" 12
The IO timing information to fill out.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Calculate the \fItimings\fP timing information from the current frequency
information in \fIcfg\fP, and the new frequency configuration
through all the IO banks, reading the state and then updating \fIiot\fP
as necessary.

This is used at the moment on initialisation to get the current
configuration so that boards do not have to carry their own setup
if the timings are correct on initialisation.
