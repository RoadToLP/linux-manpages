.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Insert a new entry into the \fIqos\fP list of requests, recompute the effective
QoS constraint value for that list and initialize the \fIreq\fP object.  The
caller needs to save that object for later use in updates and removal.

Return 1 if the effective constraint value has changed, 0 if the effective
constraint value has not changed, or a negative error code on failures.
