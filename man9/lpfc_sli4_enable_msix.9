lpfc_sli4_enable_msix \- Enable MSI-X interrupt mode to SLI-4 device
.SH SYNOPSIS

pointer to lpfc hba data structure.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This routine is invoked to enable the MSI-X interrupt vectors to device
with SLI-4 interface spec.  It also allocates MSI-X vectors and maps them
to cpus on the system.

When cfg_irq_numa is enabled, the adapter will only allocate vectors for
the number of cpus on the same numa node as this adapter.  The vectors are
allocated without requesting OS affinity mapping.  A vector will be
allocated and assigned to each online and offline cpu.  If the cpu is
online, then affinity will be set to that cpu.  If the cpu is offline, then
affinity will be set to the nearest peer cpu within the numa node that is
online.  If there are no online cpus within the numa node, affinity is not
assigned and the OS may do as it pleases. Note: cpu vector affinity mapping
is consistent with the way cpu online/offline is handled when cfg_irq_numa is
configured.

If numa mode is not enabled and there is more than 1 vector allocated, then
the driver relies on the managed irq interface where the OS assigns vector to
cpu affinity.  The driver will then use that affinity mapping to setup its
cpu mapping table.
