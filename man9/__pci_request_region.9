Mark the PCI region associated with PCI device \fIpdev\fP BAR \fIbar\fP as
being reserved by owner \fIres_name\fP.  Do not access any
address inside the PCI regions unless this call returns
successfully.

If \fIexclusive\fP is set, then the region is marked so that userspace
is explicitly not allowed to map the resource via /dev/mem or
sysfs MMIO access.

Returns 0 on success, or EBUSY on error.  A warning
message is also printed on failure.
