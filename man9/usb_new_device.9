.SH NAME
usb_new_device \- perform initial device setup (usbcore-internal)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" usb_new_device
.BI "(struct usb_device *udev "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "udev" 12
newly addressed device (in ADDRESS state)
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This is called with devices which have been detected but not fully
enumerated.  The device descriptor is available, but not descriptors
for any device configuration.  The caller must have locked either
the parent hub (if udev is a normal device) or else the
usb_bus_idr_lock (if udev is a root hub).  The parent's pointer to
udev has already been installed, but udev is not yet visible through
sysfs or other filesystem code.

This call is synchronous, and may not be used in an interrupt context.

Only the hub driver or root-hub registrar should ever call this.
.SH "RETURN"
Whether the device is configured properly or not. Zero if the
interface was registered with the driver core; else a negative errno
value.
