.SH "DESCRIPTION"
To get the integrated USB phy in MDM6600 takes some hoops. We must ensure
the shared USB bootmode GPIOs are configured, then request modem start-up,
reset and power-up.. And then we need to recycle the shared USB bootmode
GPIOs as they are also used for Out of Band (OOB) wake for the USB and
TS 27.010 serial mux.
