.SH "DESCRIPTION"
When an IOMMU fault event is received, this handler gets called with the
fault event and data as argument. The handler should return 0 on success. If
the fault is recoverable (IOMMU_FAULT_PAGE_REQ), the consumer should also
complete the fault by calling \fBiommu_page_response\fP with one of the following
response code:
- IOMMU_PAGE_RESP_SUCCESS: retry the translation
- IOMMU_PAGE_RESP_INVALID: terminate the fault
- IOMMU_PAGE_RESP_FAILURE: terminate the fault and stop reporting
page faults if possible.

Return 0 if the fault handler was installed successfully, or an error.
