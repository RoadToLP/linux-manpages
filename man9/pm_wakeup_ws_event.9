.SH NAME
pm_wakeup_ws_event \- Notify the PM core of a wakeup event.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" pm_wakeup_ws_event
.BI "(struct wakeup_source *ws "  ","
.BI "unsigned int msec "  ","
.BI "bool hard "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "ws" 12
Wakeup source object associated with the event source.
.IP "msec" 12
Anticipated event processing time (in milliseconds).
.IP "hard" 12
If set, abort suspends in progress and wake up from suspend-to-idle.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Notify the PM core of a wakeup event whose source is \fIws\fP that will take
approximately \fImsec\fP milliseconds to be processed by the kernel.  If \fIws\fP is
not active, activate it.  If \fImsec\fP is nonzero, set up the \fIws\fP' timer to
execute \fBpm_wakeup_timer_fn\fP in future.

It is safe to call this function from interrupt context.
