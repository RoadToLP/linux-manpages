.SH NAME
wimax_report_rfkill_hw \- Reports changes in the hardware RF switch
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" wimax_report_rfkill_hw
.BI "(struct wimax_dev *wimax_dev "  ","
.BI "enum wimax_rf_state state "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "wimax_dev" 12
WiMAX device descriptor
.IP "state" 12
New state of the RF Kill switch. WIMAX_RF_ON radio on,
WIMAX_RF_OFF radio off.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
When the device detects a change in the state of thehardware RF
switch, it must call this function to let the WiMAX kernel stack
know that the state has changed so it can be properly propagated.

The WiMAX stack caches the state (the driver doesn't need to). As
well, as the change is propagated it will come back as a request to
change the software state to mirror the hardware state.

If the device doesn't have a hardware kill switch, just report
it on initialization as always on (WIMAX_RF_ON, radio on).
