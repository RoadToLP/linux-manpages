.SH NAME
kernfs_activate \- activate a node which started deactivated
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" kernfs_activate
.BI "(struct kernfs_node *kn "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "kn" 12
kernfs_node whose subtree is to be activated
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
If the root has KERNFS_ROOT_CREATE_DEACTIVATED set, a newly created node
needs to be explicitly activated.  A node which hasn't been activated
isn't visible to userland and deactivation is skipped during its
removal.  This is useful to construct atomic init sequences where
creation of multiple nodes should either succeed or fail atomically.

The caller is responsible for ensuring that this function is not called
after kernfs_remove*() is invoked on \fIkn\fP.
