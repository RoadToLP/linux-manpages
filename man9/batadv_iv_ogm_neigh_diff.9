.SH NAME
batadv_iv_ogm_neigh_diff \- calculate tq difference of two neighbors
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "bool" batadv_iv_ogm_neigh_diff
.BI "(struct batadv_neigh_node *neigh1 "  ","
.BI "struct batadv_hard_iface *if_outgoing1 "  ","
.BI "struct batadv_neigh_node *neigh2 "  ","
.BI "struct batadv_hard_iface *if_outgoing2 "  ","
.BI "int *diff "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "neigh1" 12
the first neighbor object of the comparison
.IP "if_outgoing1" 12
outgoing interface for the first neighbor
.IP "neigh2" 12
the second neighbor object of the comparison
.IP "if_outgoing2" 12
outgoing interface for the second neighbor
.IP "diff" 12
pointer to integer receiving the calculated difference
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The content of *\fIdiff\fP is only valid when this function returns true.
It is less, equal to or greater than 0 if the metric via neigh1 is lower,
the same as or higher than the metric via neigh2
.SH "RETURN"
true when the difference could be calculated, false otherwise
