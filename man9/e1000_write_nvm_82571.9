.SH NAME
e1000_write_nvm_82571 \- Write to EEPROM using appropriate interface
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "s32" e1000_write_nvm_82571
.BI "(struct e1000_hw *hw "  ","
.BI "u16 offset "  ","
.BI "u16 words "  ","
.BI "u16 *data "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "hw" 12
pointer to the HW structure
.IP "offset" 12
offset within the EEPROM to be written to
.IP "words" 12
number of words to write
.IP "data" 12
16 bit word(s) to be written to the EEPROM

For non-82573 silicon, write data to EEPROM at offset using SPI interface.

If e1000e_update_nvm_checksum is not called after this function, the
EEPROM will most likely contain an invalid checksum.
