ibmvscsis_reset_queue \- Reset CRQ Queue
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" ibmvscsis_reset_queue
.BI "(struct scsi_info *vscsi "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "vscsi" 12
Pointer to our adapter structure
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function calls h_free_q and then calls h_reg_q and does all
of the bookkeeping to get us back to where we can communicate.

Actually, we don't always call h_free_crq.  A problem was discovered
where one partition would close and reopen his queue, which would
cause his partner to get a transport event, which would cause him to
close and reopen his queue, which would cause the original partition
to get a transport event, etc., etc.  To prevent this, we don't
actually close our queue if the client initiated the reset, (i.e.
either we got a transport event or we have detected that the client's
queue is gone)

EXECUTION ENVIRONMENT:
Process environment, called with interrupt lock held
