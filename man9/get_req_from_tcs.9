.SH NAME
get_req_from_tcs \- Get a stashed request that was xfering on the given TCS.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "const struct tcs_request *" get_req_from_tcs
.BI "(struct rsc_drv *drv "  ","
.BI "int tcs_id "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "drv" 12
The RSC controller.
.IP "tcs_id" 12
The global ID of this TCS.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
For ACTIVE_ONLY transfers we want to call back into the client when the
transfer finishes. To do this we need the "request" that the client
originally provided us. This function grabs the request that we stashed
when we started the transfer.

This only makes sense for ACTIVE_ONLY transfers since those are the only
ones we track sending (the only ones we enable interrupts for and the only
ones we call back to the client for).
.SH "RETURN"
The stashed request.
