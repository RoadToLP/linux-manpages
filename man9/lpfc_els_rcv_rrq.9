.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This routine processes a Reinstate Recovery Qualifier (RRQ) IOCB
received as an ELS unsolicited event. A request to RRQ shall only
be accepted if the Originator Nx_Port N_Port_ID or the Responder
Nx_Port N_Port_ID of the target Exchange is the same as the
N_Port_ID of the Nx_Port that makes the request. If the RRQ is
not accepted, an LS_RJT with reason code "Unable to perform
command request" and reason code explanation "Invalid Originator
S_ID" shall be returned. For now, we just unconditionally accept
RRQ from the target.
