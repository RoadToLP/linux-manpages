.SH NAME
event_triggers_call \- Call triggers associated with a trace event
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "enum event_trigger_type" event_triggers_call
.BI "(struct trace_event_file *file "  ","
.BI "void *rec "  ","
.BI "struct ring_buffer_event *event "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "file" 12
The trace_event_file associated with the event
.IP "rec" 12
The trace entry for the event, NULL for unconditional invocation
.IP "event" 12
-- undescribed --
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
For each trigger associated with an event, invoke the trigger
function registered with the associated trigger command.  If rec is
non-NULL, it means that the trigger requires further processing and
shouldn't be unconditionally invoked.  If rec is non-NULL and the
trigger has a filter associated with it, rec will checked against
the filter and if the record matches the trigger will be invoked.
If the trigger is a 'post_trigger', meaning it shouldn't be invoked
in any case until the current event is written, the trigger
function isn't invoked but the bit associated with the deferred
trigger is set in the return value.

Returns an enum event_trigger_type value containing a set bit for
any trigger that should be deferred, ETT_NONE if nothing to defer.

Called from tracepoint handlers (with \fBrcu_read_lock_sched\fP held).
.SH "RETURN"
an enum event_trigger_type value containing a set bit for
any trigger that should be deferred, ETT_NONE if nothing to defer.
