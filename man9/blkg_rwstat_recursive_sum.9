.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "blkg" 12
blkg of interest
.IP "pol" 12
blkcg_policy which contains the blkg_rwstat
.IP "off" 12
offset to the blkg_rwstat in blkg_policy_data or \fIblkg\fP
.IP "sum" 12
blkg_rwstat_sample structure containing the results
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Collect the blkg_rwstat specified by \fIblkg\fP, \fIpol\fP and \fIoff\fP and all its
online descendants and their aux counts.  The caller must be holding the
queue lock for online tests.

If \fIpol\fP is NULL, blkg_rwstat is at \fIoff\fP bytes into \fIblkg\fP; otherwise, it
is at \fIoff\fP bytes into \fIblkg\fP's blkg_policy_data of the policy.
