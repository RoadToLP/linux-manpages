.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Call \fIdrm_bridge_funcs.hpd_enable\fP if implemented and register the given \fIcb\fP
and \fIdata\fP as hot plug notification callback. From now on the \fIcb\fP will be
called with \fIdata\fP when an output status change is detected by the bridge,
until hot plug notification gets disabled with \fBdrm_bridge_hpd_disable\fP.

Hot plug detection is supported only if the DRM_BRIDGE_OP_HPD flag is set in
bridge->ops. This function shall not be called when the flag is not set.

Only one hot plug detection callback can be registered at a time, it is an
error to call this function when hot plug detection is already enabled for
the bridge.
