.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This is called before each entry into the hypervisor to setup any
debug related registers.

Additionally, KVM only traps guest accesses to the debug registers if
the guest is not actively using them (see the KVM_ARM64_DEBUG_DIRTY
flag on vcpu->arch.flags).  Since the guest must not interfere
with the hardware state when debugging the guest, we must ensure that
trapping is enabled whenever we are debugging the guest using the
debug registers.
