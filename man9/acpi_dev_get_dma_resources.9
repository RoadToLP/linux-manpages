.SH NAME
acpi_dev_get_dma_resources \- Get current DMA resources of a device.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" acpi_dev_get_dma_resources
.BI "(struct acpi_device *adev "  ","
.BI "struct list_head *list "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "adev" 12
ACPI device node to get the resources for.
.IP "list" 12
Head of the resultant list of resources (must be empty).
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Evaluate the _DMA method for the given device node and process its
output.

The resultant struct resource objects are put on the list pointed to
by \fIlist\fP, that must be empty initially, as members of struct
resource_entry objects.  Callers of this routine should use
\fBacpi_dev_free_resource_list\fP to free that list.

The number of resources in the output list is returned on success,
an error code reflecting the error condition is returned otherwise.
