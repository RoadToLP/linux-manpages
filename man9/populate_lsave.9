.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function is only called for the "big" model. It records a small number
of LEB numbers of important LEBs.  Important LEBs are ones that are (from
most important to least important): empty, freeable, freeable index, dirty
index, dirty or free. Upon mount, we read this list of LEB numbers and bring
their pnodes into memory.  That will stop us from having to scan the LPT
straight away. For the "small" model we assume that scanning the LPT is no
big deal.
