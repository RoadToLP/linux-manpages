.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function is a wrapper around \fBvfs_getattr\fP.  The main difference is
that it uses a filename and base directory to determine the file location.
Additionally, the use of AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW in flags will prevent a symlink
at the given name from being referenced.

0 will be returned on success, and a -ve error code if unsuccessful.
