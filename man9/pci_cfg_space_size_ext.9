.SH NAME
pci_cfg_space_size_ext \- Get the configuration space size of the PCI device
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" pci_cfg_space_size_ext
.BI "(struct pci_dev *dev "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dev" 12
PCI device
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Regular PCI devices have 256 bytes, but PCI-X 2 and PCI Express devices
have 4096 bytes.  Even if the device is capable, that doesn't mean we can
access it.  Maybe we don't have a way to generate extended config space
accesses, or the device is behind a reverse Express bridge.  So we try
reading the dword at 0x100 which must either be 0 or a valid extended
capability header.
