.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This is called to activate endpoints and let the network layer know
the connection is active ("carrier detect").  It may cause the I/O
queues to open and start letting network packets flow, but will in
any case activate the endpoints so that they respond properly to the
USB host.

Verify net_device pointer returned using \fBIS_ERR\fP.  If it doesn't
indicate some error code (negative errno), ep->driver_data values
have been overwritten.
