.SH NAME
snd_soc_set_dmi_name \- Register DMI names to card
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" snd_soc_set_dmi_name
.BI "(struct snd_soc_card *card "  ","
.BI "const char *flavour "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "card" 12
The card to register DMI names
.IP "flavour" 12
The flavour "differentiator" for the card amongst its peers.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
An Intel machine driver may be used by many different devices but are
difficult for userspace to differentiate, since machine drivers ususally
use their own name as the card short name and leave the card long name
blank. To differentiate such devices and fix bugs due to lack of
device-specific configurations, this function allows DMI info to be used
as the sound card long name, in the format of
"vendor-product-version-board"
(Character '-' is used to separate different DMI fields here).
This will help the user space to load the device-specific Use Case Manager
(UCM) configurations for the card.

Possible card long names may be:
DellInc.-XPS139343-01-0310JH
ASUSTeKCOMPUTERINC.-T100TA-1.0-T100TA
Circuitco-MinnowboardMaxD0PLATFORM-D0-MinnowBoardMAX

This function also supports flavoring the card longname to provide
the extra differentiation, like "vendor-product-version-board-flavor".

We only keep number and alphabet characters and a few separator characters
in the card long name since UCM in the user space uses the card long names
as card configuration directory names and AudoConf cannot support special
charactors like SPACE.

Returns 0 on success, otherwise a negative error code.
