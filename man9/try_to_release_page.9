.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The address_space is to try to release any data against the page
(presumably at page->private).

This may also be called if PG_fscache is set on a page, indicating that the
page is known to the local caching routines.

The \fIgfp_mask\fP argument specifies whether I/O may be performed to release
this page (__GFP_IO), and whether the call may block (__GFP_RECLAIM & __GFP_FS).
.SH "RETURN"
1 if the release was successful, otherwise return zero.
