.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" lpfc_cancel_retry_delay_tmo
.BI "(struct lpfc_vport *vport "  ","
.BI "struct lpfc_nodelist *nlp "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "vport" 12
pointer to a host virtual N_Port data structure.
.IP "nlp" 12
pointer to a node-list data structure.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This routine cancels the timer with a delayed IOCB-command retry for
a \fIvport\fP's \fIndlp\fP. It stops the timer for the delayed function retrial and
removes the ELS retry event if it presents. In addition, if the
NLP_NPR_2B_DISC bit is set in the \fInlp\fP's nlp_flag bitmap, ADISC IOCB
commands are sent for the \fIvport\fP's nodes that require issuing discovery
ADISC.
