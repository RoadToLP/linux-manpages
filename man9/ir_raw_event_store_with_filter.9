.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This routine (which may be called from an interrupt context) works
in similar manner to ir_raw_event_store_edge.
This routine is intended for devices with limited internal buffer
It automerges samples of same type, and handles timeouts. Returns non-zero
if the event was added, and zero if the event was ignored due to idle
processing.
