.SH "DESCRIPTION"

On X8664 this does not use interrupt stacks as they can't work before
\fBcpu_init\fP is invoked and sets up TSS. The IST variant is installed
after that.

Note, that X86_64 cannot install the real #PF handler in
\fBidt_setup_early_traps\fP because the memory intialization needs the #PF
handler from the early_idt_handler_array to initialize the early page
tables.
