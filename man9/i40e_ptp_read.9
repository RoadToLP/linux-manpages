timespec structure to hold the current time value
.IP "sts" 12
structure to hold the system time before and after reading the PHC

This function reads the PRTTSYN_TIME registers and stores them in a
timespec. However, since the registers are 64 bits of nanoseconds, we must
convert the result to a timespec before we can return.
