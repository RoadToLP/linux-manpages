PCI device to reset
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Some devices allow an individual function to be reset without affecting
other functions in the same device.  The PCI device must be responsive
to PCI config space in order to use this function.

The device function is presumed to be unused and the caller is holding
the device mutex lock when this function is called.

Resetting the device will make the contents of PCI configuration space
random, so any caller of this must be prepared to reinitialise the
device including MSI, bus mastering, BARs, decoding IO and memory spaces,
etc.

Returns 0 if the device function was successfully reset or negative if the
device doesn't support resetting a single function.
