sysfs_unbreak_active_protection \- restore "active" protection
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" sysfs_unbreak_active_protection
.BI "(struct kernfs_node *kn "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "kn" 12
Pointer returned by \fBsysfs_break_active_protection\fP.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Undo the effects of \fBsysfs_break_active_protection\fP. Since this function
calls \fBkernfs_put\fP on the kernfs node that corresponds to the 'attr'
argument passed to \fBsysfs_break_active_protection\fP that attribute may have
been removed between the \fBsysfs_break_active_protection\fP and
\fBsysfs_unbreak_active_protection\fP calls, it is not safe to access \fIkn\fP after
this function has returned.
