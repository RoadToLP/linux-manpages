.SH NAME
bch_encode \- calculate BCH ecc parity of data
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" bch_encode
.BI "(struct bch_control *bch "  ","
.BI "const uint8_t *data "  ","
.BI "unsigned int len "  ","
.BI "uint8_t *ecc "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "bch" 12
BCH control structure
.IP "data" 12
data to encode
.IP "len" 12
data length in bytes
.IP "ecc" 12
ecc parity data, must be initialized by caller
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The \fIecc\fP parity array is used both as input and output parameter, in order to
allow incremental computations. It should be of the size indicated by member
\fIecc_bytes\fP of \fIbch\fP, and should be initialized to 0 before the first call.

The exact number of computed ecc parity bits is given by member \fIecc_bits\fP of
\fIbch\fP; it may be less than m*t for large values of t.
