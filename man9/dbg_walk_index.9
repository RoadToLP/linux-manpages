.SH NAME
dbg_walk_index \- walk the on-flash index.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" dbg_walk_index
.BI "(struct ubifs_info *c "  ","
.BI "dbg_leaf_callback leaf_cb "  ","
.BI "dbg_znode_callback znode_cb "  ","
.BI "void *priv "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "c" 12
UBIFS file-system description object
.IP "leaf_cb" 12
called for each leaf node
.IP "znode_cb" 12
called for each indexing node
.IP "priv" 12
private data which is passed to callbacks
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function walks the UBIFS index and calls the \fIleaf_cb\fP for each leaf
node and \fIznode_cb\fP for each indexing node. Returns zero in case of success
and a negative error code in case of failure.

It would be better if this function removed every znode it pulled to into
the TNC, so that the behavior more closely matched the non-debugging
behavior.
