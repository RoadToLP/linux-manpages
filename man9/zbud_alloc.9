.SH NAME
zbud_alloc \- allocates a region of a given size
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" zbud_alloc
.BI "(struct zbud_pool *pool "  ","
.BI "size_t size "  ","
.BI "gfp_t gfp "  ","
.BI "unsigned long *handle "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "pool" 12
zbud pool from which to allocate
.IP "size" 12
size in bytes of the desired allocation
.IP "gfp" 12
gfp flags used if the pool needs to grow
.IP "handle" 12
handle of the new allocation
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function will attempt to find a free region in the pool large enough to
satisfy the allocation request.  A search of the unbuddied lists is
performed first. If no suitable free region is found, then a new page is
allocated and added to the pool to satisfy the request.

gfp should not set __GFP_HIGHMEM as highmem pages cannot be used
as zbud pool pages.
.SH "RETURN"
0 if success and handle is set, otherwise -EINVAL if the size or
gfp arguments are invalid or -ENOMEM if the pool was unable to allocate
a new page.
