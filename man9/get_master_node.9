.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "c" 12
UBIFS file-system description object
.IP "lnum" 12
LEB number
.IP "pbuf" 12
buffer containing the LEB read, is returned here
.IP "mst" 12
master node, if found, is returned here
.IP "cor" 12
corruption, if found, is returned here
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function allocates a buffer, reads the LEB into it, and finds and
returns the last valid master node allowing for one area of corruption.
The corrupt area, if there is one, must be consistent with the assumption
that it is the result of an unclean unmount while the master node was being
written. Under those circumstances, it is valid to use the previously written
master node.

This function returns 0 on success and a negative error code on failure.
