.SH NAME
per_cpu_ptr_to_phys \- convert translated percpu address to physical address
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "phys_addr_t" per_cpu_ptr_to_phys
.BI "(void *addr "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "addr" 12
the address to be converted to physical address
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Given \fIaddr\fP which is dereferenceable address obtained via one of
percpu access macros, this function translates it into its physical
address.  The caller is responsible for ensuring \fIaddr\fP stays valid
until this function finishes.

percpu allocator has special setup for the first chunk, which currently
supports either embedding in linear address space or vmalloc mapping,
and, from the second one, the backing allocator (currently either vm or
km) provides translation.

The addr can be translated simply without checking if it falls into the
first chunk. But the current code reflects better how percpu allocator
actually works, and the verification can discover both bugs in percpu
allocator itself and \fBper_cpu_ptr_to_phys\fP callers. So we keep current
code.
.SH "RETURN"
The physical address for \fIaddr\fP.
