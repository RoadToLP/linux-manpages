.SH NAME
lpfc_discovery_wait \- Wait for driver discovery to quiesce
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" lpfc_discovery_wait
.BI "(struct lpfc_vport *vport "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "vport" 12
The virtual port for which this call is being executed.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This driver calls this routine specifically from lpfc_vport_delete
to enforce a synchronous execution of vport
delete relative to discovery activities.  The
lpfc_vport_delete routine should not return until it
can reasonably guarantee that discovery has quiesced.
Post FDISC LOGO, the driver must wait until its SAN teardown is
complete and all resources recovered before allowing
cleanup.

This routine does not require any locks held.
