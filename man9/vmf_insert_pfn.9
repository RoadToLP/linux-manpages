.SH NAME
vmf_insert_pfn \- insert single pfn into user vma
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "vm_fault_t" vmf_insert_pfn
.BI "(struct vm_area_struct *vma "  ","
.BI "unsigned long addr "  ","
.BI "unsigned long pfn "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "vma" 12
user vma to map to
.IP "addr" 12
target user address of this page
.IP "pfn" 12
source kernel pfn
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Similar to vm_insert_page, this allows drivers to insert individual pages
they've allocated into a user vma. Same comments apply.

This function should only be called from a vm_ops->fault handler, and
in that case the handler should return the result of this function.

vma cannot be a COW mapping.

As this is called only for pages that do not currently exist, we
do not need to flush old virtual caches or the TLB.
.SH "CONTEXT"
Process context.  May allocate using GFP_KERNEL.
.SH "RETURN"
vm_fault_t value.
