.SH NAME
pci_dev_present \- Returns 1 if device matching the device list is present, 0 if not.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" pci_dev_present
.BI "(const struct pci_device_id *ids "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "ids" 12
A pointer to a null terminated list of struct pci_device_id structures
that describe the type of PCI device the caller is trying to find.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Obvious fact: You do not have a reference to any device that might be found
by this function, so if that device is removed from the system right after
this function is finished, the value will be stale.  Use this function to
find devices that are usually built into a system, or for a general hint as
to if another device happens to be present at this specific moment in time.
