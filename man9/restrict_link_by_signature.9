.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dest_keyring" 12
Keyring being linked to.
.IP "type" 12
The type of key being added.
.IP "payload" 12
The payload of the new key.
.IP "trust_keyring" 12
A ring of keys that can be used to vouch for the new cert.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Check the new certificate against the ones in the trust keyring.  If one of
those is the signing key and validates the new certificate, then mark the
new certificate as being trusted.

Returns 0 if the new certificate was accepted, -ENOKEY if we couldn't find a
matching parent certificate in the trusted list, -EKEYREJECTED if the
signature check fails or the key is blacklisted, -ENOPKG if the signature
uses unsupported crypto, or some other error if there is a matching
certificate but the signature check cannot be performed.
