.SH NAME
omap3_set_off_timings \- sets off-mode timings for a channel
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" omap3_set_off_timings
.BI "(struct voltagedomain *voltdm "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "voltdm" 12
channel to configure
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Calculates and sets up off-mode timings for a channel. Off-mode
can use either I2C based voltage scaling, or alternatively
sys_off_mode pad can be used to send a global command to power IC.n,
sys_off_mode has the additional benefit that voltages can be
scaled to zero volt level with TWL4030 / TWL5030, I2C can only
scale to 600mV.

Note that omap is not controlling the voltage scaling during
off idle signaled by sys_off_mode, so we can keep voltsetup1
as 0.
