.SH NAME
ssam_request_sync_submit \- Submit a synchronous request.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" ssam_request_sync_submit
.BI "(struct ssam_controller *ctrl "  ","
.BI "struct ssam_request_sync *rqst "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "ctrl" 12
The controller with which to submit the request.
.IP "rqst" 12
The request to submit.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Submit a synchronous request. The request has to be initialized and
properly set up, including response buffer (may be NULL if no response is
expected) and command message data. This function does not wait for the
request to be completed.

If this function succeeds, \fBssam_request_sync_wait\fP must be used to ensure
that the request has been completed before the response data can be
accessed and/or the request can be freed. On failure, the request may
immediately be freed.

This function may only be used if the controller is active, i.e. has been
initialized and not suspended.
