.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function creates all debugfs files for this instance of UBIFS.

Note, the only reason we have not merged this function with the
'\fBubifs_debugging_init\fP' function is because it is better to initialize
debugfs interfaces at the very end of the mount process, and remove them at
the very beginning of the mount process.
