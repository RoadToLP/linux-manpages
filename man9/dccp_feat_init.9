.SH NAME
dccp_feat_init \- Seed feature negotiation with host-specific defaults
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" dccp_feat_init
.BI "(struct sock *sk "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "sk" 12
Socket to initialize.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This initialises global defaults, depending on the value of the sysctls.
These can later be overridden by registering changes via setsockopt calls.
The last link in the chain is finalise_settings, to make sure that between
here and the start of actual feature negotiation no inconsistencies enter.

All features not appearing below use either defaults or are otherwise
later adjusted through \fBdccp_feat_finalise_settings\fP.
