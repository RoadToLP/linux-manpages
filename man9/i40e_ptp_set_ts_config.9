.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Respond to the user filter requests and make the appropriate hardware
changes here. The XL710 cannot support splitting of the Tx/Rx timestamping
logic, so keep track in software of whether to indicate these timestamps
or not.

It is permissible to "upgrade" the user request to a broader filter, as long
as the user receives the timestamps they care about and the user is notified
the filter has been broadened.
