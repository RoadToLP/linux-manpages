.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" batadv_forw_packet_queue
.BI "(struct batadv_forw_packet *forw_packet "  ","

.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "forw_packet" 12
the forwarding packet to queue
.IP "lock" 12
a key to the store (e.g. forw_{bat,bcast}_list_lock)
.IP "head" 12
the shelve to queue it on (e.g. forw_{bat,bcast}_list)
.IP "send_time" 12
timestamp (jiffies) when the packet is to be sent
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function tries to (re)queue a forwarding packet. Requeuing
is prevented if the according interface is shutting down
(e.g. if \fBbatadv_forw_packet_list_steal\fP was called for this
packet earlier).

Calling \fBbatadv_forw_packet_queue\fP after a call to
\fBbatadv_forw_packet_steal\fP is forbidden!

Caller needs to ensure that forw_packet->delayed_work was initialized.
