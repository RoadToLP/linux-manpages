.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Flush any pending smp-call-function callbacks queued on this CPU. This is
invoked by the generic IPI handler, as well as by a CPU about to go offline,
to ensure that all pending IPI callbacks are run before it goes completely
offline.

Loop through the call_single_queue and run all the queued callbacks.
Must be called with interrupts disabled.
