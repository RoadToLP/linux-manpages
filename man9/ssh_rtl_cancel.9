.SH NAME
ssh_rtl_cancel \- Cancel request.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "bool" ssh_rtl_cancel
.BI "(struct ssh_request *rqst "  ","
.BI "bool pending "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "rqst" 12
The request to cancel.
.IP "pending" 12
Whether to also cancel pending requests.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Cancels the given request. If \fIpending\fP is false, this will not cancel
pending requests, i.e. requests that have already been submitted to the
packet layer but not been completed yet. If \fIpending\fP is true, this will
cancel the given request regardless of the state it is in.

If the request has been canceled by calling this function, both completion
and release callbacks of the request will be executed in a reasonable
time-frame. This may happen during execution of this function, however,
there is no guarantee for this. For example, a request currently
transmitting will be canceled/completed only after transmission has
completed, and the respective callbacks will be executed on the transmitter
thread, which may happen during, but also some time after execution of the
cancel function.
.SH "RETURN"
Returns true if the given request has been canceled or completed,
either by this function or prior to calling this function, false
otherwise. If \fIpending\fP is true, this function will always return true.
