.SH "DESCRIPTION"
__d_lookup is like d_lookup, however it may (rarely) return a
false-negative result due to unrelated rename activity.

__d_lookup is slightly faster by avoiding rename_lock read seqlock,
however it must be used carefully, eg. with a following d_lookup in
the case of failure.

__d_lookup callers must be commented.
