packet type declaration

Remove a protocol handler that was previously added to the kernel
protocol handlers by \fBdev_add_pack\fP. The passed \fIpacket_type\fP is removed
from the kernel lists and can be freed or reused once this function
returns.

This call sleeps to guarantee that no CPU is looking at the packet
type after return.
