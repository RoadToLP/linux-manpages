.SH NAME
scribble_alloc \- allocate percpu scribble buffer for required size of the scribble region
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" scribble_alloc
.BI "(struct raid5_percpu *percpu "  ","
.BI "int num "  ","
.BI "int cnt "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "percpu" 12
from \fBfor_each_present_cpu\fP of the caller
.IP "num" 12
total number of disks in the array
.IP "cnt" 12
scribble objs count for required size of the scribble region
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The scribble buffer size must be enough to contain:
1/ a struct page pointer for each device in the array +2
2/ room to convert each entry in (1) to its corresponding dma
(\fBdma_map_page\fP) or page (\fBpage_address\fP) address.
.SH "NOTE"
the +2 is for the destination buffers of the ddf/raid6 case where we
calculate over all devices (not just the data blocks), using zeros in place
of the P and Q blocks.
