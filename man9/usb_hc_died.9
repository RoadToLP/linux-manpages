.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" usb_hc_died
.BI "(struct usb_hcd *hcd "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS

pointer to the HCD representing the controller
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This is called by bus glue to report a USB host controller that died
while operations may still have been pending.  It's called automatically
by the PCI glue, so only glue for non-PCI busses should need to call it.

Only call this function with the primary HCD.
