.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function performs all that is necessary to enable an
IOMMU device, either during initial attachment to a client
device, or during system/runtime resume of the device. This
includes programming all the appropriate IOMMU registers, and
managing the associated omap_hwmod's state and the device's
reset line. The function also restores any locked TLBs if
resuming after a suspend.
