.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Takes a qh that has already been scheduled (which means we know we have the
bandwdith reserved for us) and set the next_active_frame and the
start_active_frame.

This is expected to be called on qh's that weren't previously actively
running.  It just picks the next frame that we can fit into without any
thought about the past.
