.SH NAME
ad_agg_selection_logic \- select an aggregation group for a team
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" ad_agg_selection_logic
.BI "(struct aggregator *agg "  ","
.BI "bool *update_slave_arr "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "agg" 12
the aggregator we're looking at
.IP "update_slave_arr" 12
Does slave array need update?
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
It is assumed that only one aggregator may be selected for a team.

The logic of this function is to select the aggregator according to
the ad_select policy:

BOND_AD_STABLE: select the aggregator with the most ports attached to
it, and to reselect the active aggregator only if the previous
aggregator has no more ports related to it.

BOND_AD_BANDWIDTH: select the aggregator with the highest total
bandwidth, and reselect whenever a link state change takes place or the
set of slaves in the bond changes.

BOND_AD_COUNT: select the aggregator with largest number of ports
(slaves), and reselect whenever a link state change takes place or the
set of slaves in the bond changes.

FIXME: this function MUST be called with the first agg in the bond, or
\fB__get_active_agg\fP won't work correctly. This function should be better
called with the bond itself, and retrieve the first agg from it.
