.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Parse mount options:
debug=N         - ecryptfs_verbosity level for debug output
sig=XXX         - description(signature) of the key to use

Returns the dentry object of the lower-level (lower/interposed)
directory; We want to mount our stackable file system on top of
that lower directory.

The signature of the key to use must be the description of a key
already in the keyring. Mounting will fail if the key can not be
found.

Returns zero on success; non-zero on error
