.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This routine aborts all the IOCBs associated with an \fIndlp\fP from the
driver internal fabric IOCB list. The list contains fabric IOCBs to be
issued to the ELS IOCB ring. This abort function walks the fabric IOCB
list, removes each IOCB associated with the \fIndlp\fP off the list, set the
status feild to IOSTAT_LOCAL_REJECT, and invokes the callback function
associated with the IOCB.
