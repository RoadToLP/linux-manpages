.SH "DESCRIPTION"
On exynos5420 there is a silicon errata that will sometimes leave the
WAKEUP_INT bit in the CLKSEL register asserted.  This bit is 1 to indicate
that it fired and we can clear it by writing a 1 back.  Clear it to prevent
interrupts from going off constantly.

We run this code on all exynos variants because it doesn't hurt.
