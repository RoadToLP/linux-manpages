.SH NAME
radix_tree_tag_clear \- clear a tag on a radix tree node
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void *" radix_tree_tag_clear
.BI "(struct radix_tree_root *root "  ","
.BI "unsigned long index "  ","
.BI "unsigned int tag "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "root" 12
radix tree root
.IP "index" 12
index key
.IP "tag" 12
tag index

Clear the search tag (which must be < RADIX_TREE_MAX_TAGS)
corresponding to \fIindex\fP in the radix tree.  If this causes
the leaf node to have no tags set then clear the tag in the
next-to-leaf node, etc.

Returns the address of the tagged item on success, else NULL.  ie:
has the same return value and semantics as \fBradix_tree_lookup\fP.
