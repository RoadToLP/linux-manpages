.SH NAME
kvmalloc_node \- attempt to allocate physically contiguous memory, but upon failure, fall back to non-contiguous (vmalloc) allocation.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void *" kvmalloc_node
.BI "(size_t size "  ","
.BI "gfp_t flags "  ","
.BI "int node "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "size" 12
size of the request.
.IP "flags" 12
gfp mask for the allocation - must be compatible (superset) with GFP_KERNEL.
.IP "node" 12
numa node to allocate from
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Uses kmalloc to get the memory but if the allocation fails then falls back
to the vmalloc allocator. Use kvfree for freeing the memory.

Reclaim modifiers - __GFP_NORETRY and __GFP_NOFAIL are not supported.
__GFP_RETRY_MAYFAIL is supported, and it should be used only if kmalloc is
preferable to the vmalloc fallback, due to visible performance drawbacks.

Please note that any use of gfp flags outside of GFP_KERNEL is careful to not
fall back to vmalloc.
.SH "RETURN"
pointer to the allocated memory of NULL in case of failure
