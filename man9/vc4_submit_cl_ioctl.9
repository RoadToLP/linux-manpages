.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This is the main entrypoint for userspace to submit a 3D frame to
the GPU.  Userspace provides the binner command list (if
applicable), and the kernel sets up the render command list to draw
to the framebuffer described in the ioctl, using the command lists
that the 3D engine's binner will produce.
