.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Allocate new scatterlist table, copy data for HASH into it. If there was
xmit_buf filled, prepare it first, then copy page, length and offset from
source sg into it, adjusting begin and/or end for skip offset and
hash_later value.

Resulting sg table will be assigned to ctx->sg. Set flag so we can free
it after irq ends processing.
