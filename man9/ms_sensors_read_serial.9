.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Generic i2c serial number read function for Measurement Specialties devices.
This function is used for TSYS02d, HTU21, MS8607 chipset.
Refer to datasheet:
http://www.meas-spec.com/downloads/HTU2X_Serial_Number_Reading.pdf

Sensor raw MSB serial number format is the following :
[ SNB3, CRC, SNB2, CRC, SNB1, CRC, SNB0, CRC]
Sensor raw LSB serial number format is the following :
[ X, X, SNC1, SNC0, CRC, SNA1, SNA0, CRC]
The resulting serial number is following :
[ SNA1, SNA0, SNB3, SNB2, SNB1, SNB0, SNC1, SNC0]
.SH "RETURN"
0 on success, negative errno otherwise.
