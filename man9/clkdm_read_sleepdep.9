.SH NAME
clkdm_read_sleepdep \- read sleep dependency state from clkdm2 to clkdm1
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" clkdm_read_sleepdep
.BI "(struct clockdomain *clkdm1 "  ","
.BI "struct clockdomain *clkdm2 "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "clkdm1" 12
prevent this struct clockdomain * from sleeping (dependent)
.IP "clkdm2" 12
when this struct clockdomain * is active (source)
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Return 1 if a hardware sleep dependency exists wherein \fIclkdm1\fP will
not be allowed to automatically go inactive if \fIclkdm2\fP is active;
0 if \fIclkdm1\fP's automatic power state inactivity transition is independent
of \fIclkdm2\fP's; -EINVAL if either clockdomain pointer is invalid or called
on a machine that does not support software-configurable hardware sleep
dependencies; or -ENOENT if the hardware is incapable.

REVISIT: Currently this function only represents software-controllable
sleep dependencies.  Sleep dependencies fixed in hardware are not
yet handled here.
