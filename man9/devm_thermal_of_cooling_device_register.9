.SH NAME
devm_thermal_of_cooling_device_register \- register an OF thermal cooling device
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "struct thermal_cooling_device *" devm_thermal_of_cooling_device_register
.BI "(struct device *dev "  ","
.BI "struct device_node *np "  ","
.BI "char *type "  ","
.BI "void *devdata "  ","
.BI "const struct thermal_cooling_device_ops *ops "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dev" 12
a valid struct device pointer of a sensor device.
.IP "np" 12
a pointer to a device tree node.
.IP "type" 12
the thermal cooling device type.
.IP "devdata" 12
device private data.
.IP "ops" 12
standard thermal cooling devices callbacks.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function will register a cooling device with device tree node reference.
This interface function adds a new thermal cooling device (fan/processor/...)
to /sys/class/thermal/ folder as cooling_device[0-*]. It tries to bind itself
to all the thermal zone devices registered at the same time.
.SH "RETURN"
a pointer to the created struct thermal_cooling_device or an
ERR_PTR. Caller must check return value with IS_ERR*() helpers.
