.SH NAME
ir_raw_event_store_edge \- notify raw ir decoders of the start of a pulse/space
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" ir_raw_event_store_edge
.BI "(struct rc_dev *dev "  ","
.BI "bool pulse "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dev" 12
the struct rc_dev device descriptor
.IP "pulse" 12
true for pulse, false for space
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This routine (which may be called from an interrupt context) is used to
store the beginning of an ir pulse or space (or the start/end of ir
reception) for the raw ir decoding state machines. This is used by
hardware which does not provide durations directly but only interrupts
(or similar events) on state change.
