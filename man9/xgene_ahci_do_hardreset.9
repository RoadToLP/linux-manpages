.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Due to the limitation of the hardware PHY, a difference set of setting is
required for each supported disk speed - Gen3 (6.0Gbps), Gen2 (3.0Gbps),
and Gen1 (1.5Gbps). Otherwise during long IO stress test, the PHY will
report disparity error and etc. In addition, during COMRESET, there can
be error reported in the register PORT_SCR_ERR. For SERR_DISPARITY and
SERR_10B_8B_ERR, the PHY receiver line must be reseted. Also during long
reboot cycle regression, sometimes the PHY reports link down even if the
device is present because of speed negotiation failure. so need to retry
the COMRESET to get the link up. The following algorithm is followed to
proper configure the hardware PHY during COMRESET:

Alg Part 1:
1. Start the PHY at Gen3 speed (default setting)
2. Issue the COMRESET
3. If no link, go to Alg Part 3
4. If link up, determine if the negotiated speed matches the PHY
configured speed
5. If they matched, go to Alg Part 2
6. If they do not matched and first time, configure the PHY for the linked
up disk speed and repeat step 2
7. Go to Alg Part 2

Alg Part 2:
1. On link up, if there are any SERR_DISPARITY and SERR_10B_8B_ERR error
reported in the register PORT_SCR_ERR, then reset the PHY receiver line
2. Go to Alg Part 4

Alg Part 3:
1. Check the PORT_SCR_STAT to see whether device presence detected but PHY
communication establishment failed and maximum link down attempts are
less than Max attempts 3 then goto Alg Part 1.
2. Go to Alg Part 4.

Alg Part 4:
1. Clear any pending from register PORT_SCR_ERR.
.SH "NOTE"
For the initial version, we will NOT support Gen1/Gen2. In addition
and until the underlying PHY supports an method to reset the receiver
line, on detection of SERR_DISPARITY or SERR_10B_8B_ERR errors,
an warning message will be printed.
