UBIFS file-system description object
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function checks the file system, namely:
o makes sure that all leaf nodes exist and their CRCs are correct;
o makes sure inode nlink, size, xattr size/count are correct (for all
inodes).

The function reads whole indexing tree and all nodes, so it is pretty
heavy-weight. Returns zero if the file-system is consistent, -EINVAL if
not, and a negative error code in case of failure.
