.SH NAME
nx_build_sg_list \- build an NX scatter list describing a single buffer
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "struct nx_sg *" nx_build_sg_list
.BI "(struct nx_sg *sg_head "  ","
.BI "u8 *start_addr "  ","
.BI "unsigned int *len "  ","
.BI "u32 sgmax "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "sg_head" 12
pointer to the first scatter list element to build
.IP "start_addr" 12
pointer to the linear buffer
.IP "len" 12
length of the data at \fIstart_addr\fP
.IP "sgmax" 12
the largest number of scatter list elements we're allowed to create
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function will start writing nx_sg elements at \fIsg_head\fP and keep
writing them until all of the data from \fIstart_addr\fP is described or
until sgmax elements have been written. Scatter list elements will be
created such that none of the elements describes a buffer that crosses a 4K
boundary.
