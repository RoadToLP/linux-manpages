.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Although this DMA driver attempts to operate independently of the other
devices, it still needs to determine some information about the SSI device
that it's working with.  Unfortunately, the device tree does not contain
a pointer from the DMA channel node to the SSI node -- the pointer goes the
other way.  So we need to scan the device tree for SSI nodes until we find
the one that points to the given DMA channel node.  It's ugly, but at least
it's contained in this one function.
