.SH NAME
get_phy_device \- reads the specified PHY device and returns its @phy_device struct
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "struct phy_device *" get_phy_device
.BI "(struct mii_bus *bus "  ","
.BI "int addr "  ","
.BI "bool is_c45 "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "bus" 12
the target MII bus
.IP "addr" 12
PHY address on the MII bus
.IP "is_c45" 12
If true the PHY uses the 802.3 clause 45 protocol
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Probe for a PHY at \fIaddr\fP on \fIbus\fP.

When probing for a clause 22 PHY, then read the ID registers. If we find
a valid ID, allocate and return a \fIstruct phy_device\fP.

When probing for a clause 45 PHY, read the "devices in package" registers.
If the "devices in package" appears valid, read the ID registers for each
MMD, allocate and return a \fIstruct phy_device\fP.

Returns an allocated \fIstruct phy_device\fP on success, -ENODEV if there is
no PHY present, or -EIO on bus access error.
