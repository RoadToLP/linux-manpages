thermal zone we are operating in
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
For thermal zones that don't provide a sustainable_power in their
thermal_zone_params, estimate one.  Calculate it using the minimum
power of all the cooling devices as that gives a valid value that
can give some degree of functionality.  For optimal performance of
this governor, provide a sustainable_power in the thermal zone's
thermal_zone_params.
