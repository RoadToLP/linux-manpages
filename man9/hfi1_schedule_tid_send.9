.SH NAME
hfi1_schedule_tid_send \- schedule progress on TID RDMA state machine
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "bool" hfi1_schedule_tid_send
.BI "(struct rvt_qp *qp "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "qp" 12
the QP
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This schedules qp progress on the TID RDMA state machine. Caller
should hold the s_lock.
Unlike \fBhfi1_schedule_send\fP, this cannot use \fBhfi1_send_ok\fP because
the two state machines can step on each other with respect to the
RVT_S_BUSY flag.
Therefore, a modified test is used.
\fIreturn\fP true if the second leg is scheduled;
false if the second leg is not scheduled.
