.SH NAME
ipu_irq_map \- map an IPU interrupt source to an IRQ number
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" ipu_irq_map
.BI "(unsigned int source "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "source" 12
interrupt source bit position (see below)
.SH "RETURN"
mapped IRQ number or negative error code
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The source parameter has to be explained further. On i.MX31 IPU has 137 IRQ
sources, they are broken down in 5 32-bit registers, like 32, 32, 24, 32, 17.
However, the source argument of this function is not the sequence number of
the possible IRQ, but rather its bit position. So, first interrupt in fourth
register has source number 96, and not 88. This makes calculations easier,
and also provides forward compatibility with any future IPU implementations
with any interrupt bit assignments.
