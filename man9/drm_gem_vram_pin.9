.SH NAME
drm_gem_vram_pin \- Pins a GEM VRAM object in a region.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" drm_gem_vram_pin
.BI "(struct drm_gem_vram_object *gbo "  ","
.BI "unsigned long pl_flag "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gbo" 12
the GEM VRAM object
.IP "pl_flag" 12
a bitmask of possible memory regions
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Pinning a buffer object ensures that it is not evicted from
a memory region. A pinned buffer object has to be unpinned before
it can be pinned to another region. If the pl_flag argument is 0,
the buffer is pinned at its current location (video RAM or system
memory).

Small buffer objects, such as cursor images, can lead to memory
fragmentation if they are pinned in the middle of video RAM. This
is especially a problem on devices with only a small amount of
video RAM. Fragmentation can prevent the primary framebuffer from
fitting in, even though there's enough memory overall. The modifier
DRM_GEM_VRAM_PL_FLAG_TOPDOWN marks the buffer object to be pinned
at the high end of the memory region to avoid fragmentation.
.SH "RETURN"
0 on success, or
a negative error code otherwise.
