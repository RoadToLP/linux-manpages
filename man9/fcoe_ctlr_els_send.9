.SH NAME
fcoe_ctlr_els_send \- Send an ELS frame encapsulated by FIP if appropriate.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" fcoe_ctlr_els_send
.BI "(struct fcoe_ctlr *fip "  ","
.BI "struct fc_lport *lport "  ","
.BI "struct sk_buff *skb "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "fip" 12
FCoE controller.
.IP "lport" 12
libfc fc_lport to send from
.IP "skb" 12
FCoE ELS frame including FC header but no FCoE headers.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Returns a non-zero error code if the frame should not be sent.
Returns zero if the caller should send the frame with FCoE encapsulation.

The caller must check that the length is a multiple of 4.
The SKB must have enough headroom (28 bytes) and tailroom (8 bytes).
The the skb must also be an fc_frame.

This is called from the lower-level driver with spinlocks held,
so we must not take a mutex here.
