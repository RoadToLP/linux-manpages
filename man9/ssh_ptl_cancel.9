.SH NAME
ssh_ptl_cancel \- Cancel a packet.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" ssh_ptl_cancel
.BI "(struct ssh_packet *p "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "p" 12
The packet to cancel.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Cancels a packet. There are no guarantees on when completion and release
callbacks will be called. This may occur during execution of this function
or may occur at any point later.

Note that it is not guaranteed that the packet will actually be canceled if
the packet is concurrently completed by another process. The only guarantee
of this function is that the packet will be completed (with success,
failure, or cancellation) and released from the transport layer in a
reasonable time-frame.

May be called before the packet has been submitted, in which case any later
packet submission fails.
