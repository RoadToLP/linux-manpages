rvt_qp_iter \- iterate all QPs
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" rvt_qp_iter
.BI "(struct rvt_dev_info *rdi "  ","
.BI "u64 v "  ","
.BI "void (*cb)(struct rvt_qp *qp, u64 v) "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "rdi" 12
rvt devinfo
.IP "v" 12
a 64-bit value
.IP "cb" 12
a callback
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This provides a way for iterating all QPs.

The \fIcb\fP is a user-defined callback and \fIv\fP is a 64-bit
value passed to and relevant for processing in the
cb.  An example use case would be to alter QP processing
based on criteria not part of the rvt_qp.

The code has an internal iterator to simplify
non seq_file use cases.
