.SH NAME
from_kuid_munged \- Create a uid from a kuid user-namespace pair.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "uid_t" from_kuid_munged
.BI "(struct user_namespace *targ "  ","
.BI "kuid_t kuid "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "targ" 12
The user namespace we want a uid in.
.IP "kuid" 12
The kernel internal uid to start with.

Map \fIkuid\fP into the user-namespace specified by \fItarg\fP and
return the resulting uid.

There is always a mapping into the initial user_namespace.

Unlike from_kuid from_kuid_munged never fails and always
returns a valid uid.  This makes from_kuid_munged appropriate
for use in syscalls like stat and getuid where failing the
system call and failing to provide a valid uid are not an
options.

If \fIkuid\fP has no mapping in \fItarg\fP overflowuid is returned.
