.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The unused_bgs list needs to be punted to the discard lists because the
order of operations is changed.  In the normal sychronous discard path, the
block groups are trimmed via a single large trim in transaction commit.  This
is ultimately what we are trying to avoid with asynchronous discard.  Thus,
it must be done before going down the unused_bgs path.
