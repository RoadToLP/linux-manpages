.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "phba" 12
HBA structure that indicates port to create a queue on.
.IP "wq" 12
The queue structure to use to create the work queue.
.IP "cq" 12
The completion queue to bind this work queue to.
.IP "subtype" 12
The subtype of the work queue indicating its functionality.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function creates a work queue, as detailed in \fIwq\fP, on a port, described
by \fIphba\fP by sending a WQ_CREATE mailbox command to the HBA.

The \fIphba\fP struct is used to send mailbox command to HBA. The \fIwq\fP struct
is used to get the entry count and entry size that are necessary to
determine the number of pages to allocate and use for this queue. The \fIcq\fP
is used to indicate which completion queue to bind this work queue to. This
function will send the WQ_CREATE mailbox command to the HBA to setup the
work queue. This function is asynchronous and will wait for the mailbox
command to finish before continuing.

On success this function will return a zero. If unable to allocate enough
memory this function will return -ENOMEM. If the queue create mailbox command
fails this function will return -ENXIO.
