if true, caller needs VT switch at suspend/resume time
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The different console drivers may or may not require VT switches across
suspend/resume, depending on how they handle restoring video state and
what may be running.

Drivers can indicate support for switchless suspend/resume, which can
save time and flicker, by using this routine and passing 'false' as
the argument.  If any loaded driver needs VT switching, or the
no_console_suspend argument has been passed on the command line, VT
switches will occur.
