\fBfind_lock_entries\fP will return a batch of entries from \fImapping\fP.
Swap, shadow and DAX entries are included.  Pages are returned

somebody else or under writeback are skipped.  Only the head page of
a THP is returned.  Pages which are partially outside the range are
not returned.

The entries have ascending indexes.  The indices may not be consecutive
due to not-present entries, THP pages, pages which could not be locked
or pages under writeback.
