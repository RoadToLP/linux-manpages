.SH "DESCRIPTION"

MTRRs can override PAT memory types with 4KiB granularity. Therefore, this
function sets up a huge page only if any of the following conditions are met:

- MTRRs are disabled, or

- MTRRs are enabled and the range is completely covered by a single MTRR, or

- MTRRs are enabled and the corresponding MTRR memory type is WB, which
has no effect on the requested PAT memory type.

Callers should try to decrease page size (1GB -> 2MB -> 4K) if the bigger
page mapping attempt fails.

Returns 1 on success and 0 on failure.
