.SH NAME
ds1685_rtc_begin_data_access \- prepare the rtc for data access.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" ds1685_rtc_begin_data_access
.BI "(struct ds1685_priv *rtc "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "rtc" 12
pointer to the ds1685 rtc structure.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This takes several steps to prepare the rtc for access to get/set time
and alarm values from the rtc registers:
- Sets the SET bit in Control Register B.
- Reads Ext Control Register 4A and checks the INCR bit.
- If INCR is active, a short delay is added before Ext Control Register 4A
is read again in a loop until INCR is inactive.
- Switches the rtc to bank 1.  This allows access to all relevant
data for normal rtc operation, as bank 0 contains only the nvram.
