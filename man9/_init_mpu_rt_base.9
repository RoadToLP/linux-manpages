.SH NAME
_init_mpu_rt_base \- populate the virtual address for a hwmod
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" _init_mpu_rt_base
.BI "(struct omap_hwmod *oh "  ","
.BI "void *data "  ","
.BI "int index "  ","
.BI "struct device_node *np "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "oh" 12
struct omap_hwmod * to locate the virtual address
.IP "data" 12
(unused, caller should pass NULL)
.IP "index" 12
index of the reg entry iospace in device tree
.IP "np" 12
struct device_node * of the IP block's device node in the DT data
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Cache the virtual address used by the MPU to access this IP block's
registers.  This address is needed early so the OCP registers that
are part of the device's address space can be ioremapped properly.

If SYSC access is not needed, the registers will not be remapped
and non-availability of MPU access is not treated as an error.

Returns 0 on success, -EINVAL if an invalid hwmod is passed, and
-ENXIO on absent or invalid register target address space.
