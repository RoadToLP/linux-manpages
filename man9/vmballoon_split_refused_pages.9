.SH "DESCRIPTION"

If inflation of 2MB pages was denied by the hypervisor, it is likely to be
due to one or few 4KB pages. These 2MB pages may keep being allocated and
then being refused. To prevent this case, this function splits the refused
pages into 4KB pages and adds them into \fIprealloc_pages\fP list.
