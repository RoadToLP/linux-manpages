.SH NAME
text_poke_kgdb \- Update instructions on a live kernel by kgdb
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void *" text_poke_kgdb
.BI "(void *addr "  ","
.BI "const void *opcode "  ","
.BI "size_t len "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "addr" 12
address to modify
.IP "opcode" 12
source of the copy
.IP "len" 12
length to copy
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Only atomic text poke/set should be allowed when not doing early patching.
It means the size must be writable atomically and the address must be aligned
in a way that permits an atomic write. It also makes sure we fit on a single
page.
.SH "CONTEXT"
should only be used by kgdb, which ensures no other core is running,
despite the fact it does not hold the text_mutex.
