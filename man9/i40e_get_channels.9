.SH "DESCRIPTION"
We don't support separate tx and rx queues as channels. The other count
represents how many queues are being used for control. max_combined counts
how many queue pairs we can support. They may not be mapped 1 to 1 with
q_vectors since we support a lot more queue pairs than q_vectors.
