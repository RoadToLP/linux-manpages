.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Handles all the bits of the keyboard driver related to non-matrix buttons
and switches, including asking the EC about which are present and telling
the kernel to expect them.

If this device has no support for buttons and switches we'll return no error
but the ckdev->bs_idev will remain NULL when this function exits.

Returns 0 if no error or -error upon error.
