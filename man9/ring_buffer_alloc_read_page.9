.SH NAME
ring_buffer_alloc_read_page \- allocate a page to read from buffer
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void *" ring_buffer_alloc_read_page
.BI "(struct trace_buffer *buffer "  ","
.BI "int cpu "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "buffer" 12
the buffer to allocate for.
.IP "cpu" 12
the cpu buffer to allocate.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function is used in conjunction with ring_buffer_read_page.
When reading a full page from the ring buffer, these functions
can be used to speed up the process. The calling function should
allocate a few pages first with this function. Then when it
needs to get pages from the ring buffer, it passes the result
of this function into ring_buffer_read_page, which will swap
the page that was allocated, with the read page of the buffer.
.SH "RETURN"
The page allocated, or ERR_PTR
