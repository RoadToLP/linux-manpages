The controller for which the IRQ should be armed.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Sets up the IRQ so that it can be used to wake the device. Specifically,
this function enables the irq and then, if the device is allowed to wake up
the system, calls \fBenable_irq_wake\fP. See \fBssam_irq_disarm_wakeup\fP for the
corresponding function to disable the IRQ.

This function is intended to arm the IRQ before entering S2idle suspend.
.SH "NOTE"
calls to \fBssam_irq_arm_for_wakeup\fP and \fBssam_irq_disarm_wakeup\fP must
be balanced.
