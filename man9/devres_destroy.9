.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Find the latest devres of \fIdev\fP associated with \fIrelease\fP and for
which \fImatch\fP returns 1.  If \fImatch\fP is NULL, it's considered to
match all.  If found, the resource is removed atomically and freed.

Note that the release function for the resource will not be called,
only the devres-allocated data will be freed.  The caller becomes
responsible for freeing any other data.
.SH "RETURN"
0 if devres is found and freed, -ENOENT if not found.
