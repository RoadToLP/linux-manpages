Expands (or creates identical copy, if \fInhead\fP and \fIntail\fP are zero)
header of \fIskb\fP. \fIsk_buff\fP itself is not changed. \fIsk_buff\fP MUST have
reference count of 1. Returns zero in the case of success or error,
if expansion failed. In the last case, \fIsk_buff\fP is not changed.

All the pointers pointing into skb header may change and must be
reloaded after call to this function.
