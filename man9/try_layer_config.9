.SH "DESCRIPTION"
If the requested lconfig is completely rejected and the value of lconfig on
exit is the current lconfig, then \fBtry_layer_config\fP returns 1.  Otherwise,
\fBtry_layer_config\fP returns 0.  A return value of 0 does not necessarily mean
that the value of lconfig on exit is identical to the value of lconfig on
entry, but merely that it represents a change from the current lconfig.
