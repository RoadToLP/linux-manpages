.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Locate any valid recovery information from the journal and set up the
journal structures in memory to ignore it (presumably because the
caller has evidence that it is out of date).
This function doesn't appear to be exported..

We perform one pass over the journal to allow us to tell the user how
much recovery information is being erased, and to let us initialise
the journal transaction sequence numbers to the next unused ID.
