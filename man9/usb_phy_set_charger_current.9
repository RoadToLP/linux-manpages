.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" usb_phy_set_charger_current
.BI "(struct usb_phy *usb_phy "  ","
.BI "unsigned int mA "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "usb_phy" 12
the USB phy to be used
.IP "mA" 12
the current need to be set
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Usually we only change the charger default current when USB finished the
enumeration as one SDP charger. As one SDP charger, \fBusb_phy_set_power\fP
will issue this function to change charger current when after setting USB
configuration, or suspend/resume USB. For other type charger, we should
use the default charger current and we do not suggest to issue this function
to change the charger current.

When USB charger current has been changed, we need to notify the power users.
