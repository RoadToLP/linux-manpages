.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Return a trace event file given the trace instance name, trace
system, and trace event name.  If the instance name is NULL, it
refers to the top-level trace array.

This function will look it up and return it if found, after calling
\fBtrace_array_get\fP to prevent the instance from going away, and
increment the event's module refcount to prevent it from being
removed.

To release the file, call \fBtrace_put_event_file\fP, which will call
\fBtrace_array_put\fP and decrement the event's module refcount.
.SH "RETURN"
The trace event on success, ERR_PTR otherwise.
