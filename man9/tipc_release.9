.SH NAME
tipc_release \- destroy a TIPC socket
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" tipc_release
.BI "(struct socket *sock "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "sock" 12
socket to destroy
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This routine cleans up any messages that are still queued on the socket.
For DGRAM and RDM socket types, all queued messages are rejected.
For SEQPACKET and STREAM socket types, the first message is rejected
and any others are discarded.  (If the first message on a STREAM socket
is partially-read, it is discarded and the next one is rejected instead.)
.SH "NOTE"
Rejected messages are not necessarily returned to the sender!  They
are returned or discarded according to the "destination droppable" setting
specified for the message by the sender.
.SH "RETURN"
0 on success, errno otherwise
