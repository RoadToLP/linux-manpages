.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "fdt" 12
Base Device Tree blob
.IP "fdto" 12
Device tree overlay blob
.IP "symbols_off" 12
Node offset of the symbols node in the base device tree
.IP "path" 12
Path to a node holding a phandle in the overlay
.IP "path_len" 12
number of path characters to consider
.IP "name" 12
Name of the property holding the phandle reference in the overlay
.IP "name_len" 12
number of name characters to consider
.IP "poffset" 12
Offset within the overlay property where the phandle is stored
.IP "label" 12
Label of the node referenced by the phandle
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBoverlay_fixup_one_phandle\fP resolves an overlay phandle pointing to
a node in the base device tree.

This is part of the device tree overlay application process, when
you want all the phandles in the overlay to point to the actual
base dt nodes.
.SH "RETURN"
0 on success
Negative error code on failure
