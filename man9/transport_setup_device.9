.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" transport_setup_device
.BI "(struct device *dev "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dev" 12
the generic device representing the entity being added
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Usually, dev represents some component in the HBA system (either
the HBA itself or a device remote across the HBA bus).  This
routine is simply a trigger point to see if any set of transport
classes wishes to associate with the added device.  This allocates
storage for the class device and initialises it, but does not yet
add it to the system or add attributes to it (you do this with
transport_add_device).  If you have no need for a separate setup
and add operations, use transport_register_device (see
transport_class.h).
