The destination string \fIout\fP is allocated by this function and the caller is
responsible for freeing it with \fBkfree\fP

On return, *\fIout_len\fP is the length of \fIout\fP in bytes.

On success, the return value is the number of utf8 characters written to
the output buffer \fIout\fP.

On Failure, a negative number coresponding to the error code is returned.
