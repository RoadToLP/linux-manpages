.SH NAME
befs_bt_keylen_index \- Finds start of keylen index in a node
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "fs16 *" befs_bt_keylen_index
.BI "(struct befs_btree_node *node "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "node" 12
Pointer to the node structure to find the keylen index within
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Returns a pointer to the start of the key length index array
of the B+tree node *\fInode\fP

"The length of all the keys in the node is added to the size of the
header and then rounded up to a multiple of four to get the beginning
of the key length index" (p.88, practical filesystem design).

Except that rounding up to 8 works, and rounding up to 4 doesn't.
