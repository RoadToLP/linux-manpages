.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This routine is used for processing the WQE associated with a unsolicited
event. It first determines whether there is an existing ndlp that matches
the DID from the unsolicited WQE. If not, it will create a new one with
the DID from the unsolicited WQE. The ELS command from the unsolicited
WQE is then used to invoke the proper routine and to set up proper state
of the discovery state machine.
