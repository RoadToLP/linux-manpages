.SH NAME
release_mem_region_adjustable \- release a previously reserved memory region
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" release_mem_region_adjustable
.BI "(resource_size_t start "  ","
.BI "resource_size_t size "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "start" 12
resource start address
.IP "size" 12
resource region size
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This interface is intended for memory hot-delete.  The requested region
is released from a currently busy memory resource.  The requested region
must either match exactly or fit into a single busy resource entry.  In
the latter case, the remaining resource is adjusted accordingly.
Existing children of the busy memory resource must be immutable in the
request.
.SH "NOTE"
- Additional release conditions, such as overlapping region, can be
supported after they are confirmed as valid cases.
- When a busy memory resource gets split into two entries, the code
assumes that all children remain in the lower address entry for
simplicity.  Enhance this logic when necessary.
