.SH NAME
fsverity_verify_bio \- verify a 'read' bio that has just completed
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" fsverity_verify_bio
.BI "(struct bio *bio "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "bio" 12
the bio to verify
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Verify a set of pages that have just been read from a verity file.  The pages
must be pagecache pages that are still locked and not yet uptodate.  Pages
that fail verification are set to the Error state.  Verification is skipped
for pages already in the Error state, e.g. due to fscrypt decryption failure.

This is a helper function for use by the ->\fBreadpages\fP method of filesystems
that issue bios to read data directly into the page cache.  Filesystems that
populate the page cache without issuing bios (e.g. non block-based
filesystems) must instead call \fBfsverity_verify_page\fP directly on each page.
All filesystems must also call \fBfsverity_verify_page\fP on holes.
