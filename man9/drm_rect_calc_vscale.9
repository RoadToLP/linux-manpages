.SH NAME
drm_rect_calc_vscale \- calculate the vertical scaling factor
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" drm_rect_calc_vscale
.BI "(const struct drm_rect *src "  ","
.BI "const struct drm_rect *dst "  ","
.BI "int min_vscale "  ","
.BI "int max_vscale "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "src" 12
source window rectangle
.IP "dst" 12
destination window rectangle
.IP "min_vscale" 12
minimum allowed vertical scaling factor
.IP "max_vscale" 12
maximum allowed vertical scaling factor
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Calculate the vertical scaling factor as
(\fIsrc\fP height) / (\fIdst\fP height).

If the scale is below 1 << 16, round down. If the scale is above
1 << 16, round up. This will calculate the scale with the most
pessimistic limit calculation.
.SH "RETURN"
The vertical scaling factor, or errno of out of limits.
