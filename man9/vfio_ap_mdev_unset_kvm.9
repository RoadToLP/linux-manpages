.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" vfio_ap_mdev_unset_kvm
.BI "(struct ap_matrix_mdev *matrix_mdev "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "matrix_mdev" 12
a matrix mediated device
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Performs clean-up of resources no longer needed by \fImatrix_mdev\fP.
.SH "NOTE"
The matrix_dev->lock must be taken prior to calling
this function; however, the lock will be temporarily released while the
guest's AP configuration is cleared to avoid a potential lockdep splat.
The kvm->lock is taken to clear the guest's AP configuration which, under
certain circumstances, will result in a circular lock dependency if this is
done under the \fImatrix_mdev->lock\fP.
