.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Record the information associated with a seccomp action. Event filtering for
seccomp actions that are not to be logged is done in \fBseccomp_log\fP.
Therefore, this function forces auditing independent of the audit_enabled
and dummy context state because seccomp actions should be logged even when
audit is not in use.
