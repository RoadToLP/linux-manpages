.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" iavf_alloc_queues
.BI "(struct iavf_adapter *adapter "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS

board private structure to initialize
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
We allocate one ring per queue at run-time since we don't know the
number of queues at compile-time.  The polling_netdev array is
intended for Multiqueue, but should work fine with a single queue.
