.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Setup handling of the SMBus host-notify protocol on a given I2C bus segment.

Handling is done by creating a device and its callback and handling data
received via the SMBus host-notify address (0x8)

This returns the client, which should be ultimately freed using
\fBi2c_free_slave_host_notify_device\fP; or an ERRPTR to indicate an error.
