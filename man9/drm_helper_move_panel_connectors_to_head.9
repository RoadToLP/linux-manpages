.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Some userspace presumes that the first connected connector is the main
display, where it's supposed to display e.g. the login screen. For
laptops, this should be the main panel. Use this function to sort all
(eDP/LVDS/DSI) panels to the front of the connector list, instead of
painstakingly trying to initialize them in the right order.
