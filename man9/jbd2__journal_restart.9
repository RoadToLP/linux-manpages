.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Restart a handle for a multi-transaction filesystem
operation.

If the \fBjbd2_journal_extend\fP call above fails to grant new buffer credits
to a running handle, a call to jbd2_journal_restart will commit the
handle's transaction so far and reattach the handle to a new
transaction capable of guaranteeing the requested number of
credits. We preserve reserved handle if there's any attached to the
passed in handle.
