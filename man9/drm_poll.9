.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function must be used by drivers as their \fIfile_operations.read\fP method
iff they use DRM events for asynchronous signalling to userspace.  Since
events are used by the KMS API for vblank and page flip completion this means
all modern display drivers must use it.

See also \fBdrm_read\fP.

Mask of POLL flags indicating the current status of the file.
