.SH NAME
exynos5_switch_timing_regs \- Changes bank register set for DRAM timings
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" exynos5_switch_timing_regs
.BI "(struct exynos5_dmc *dmc "  ","
.BI "bool set "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dmc" 12
device for which the new settings is going to be applied
.IP "set" 12
boolean variable passing set value
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Changes the register set, which holds timing parameters.
There is two register sets: 0 and 1. The register set 0
is used in normal operation when the clock is provided from main PLL.
The bank register set 1 is used when the main PLL frequency is going to be
changed and the clock is taken from alternative, stable source.
This function switches between these banks according to the
currently used clock source.
