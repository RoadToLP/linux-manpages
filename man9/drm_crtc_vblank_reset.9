.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Drivers can use this function to reset the vblank state to off at load time.
Drivers should use this together with the \fBdrm_crtc_vblank_off\fP and
\fBdrm_crtc_vblank_on\fP functions. The difference compared to
\fBdrm_crtc_vblank_off\fP is that this function doesn't save the vblank counter
and hence doesn't need to call any driver hooks.

This is useful for recovering driver state e.g. on driver load, or on resume.
