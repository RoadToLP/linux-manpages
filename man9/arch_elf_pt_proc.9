arch_elf_pt_proc \- check a PT_LOPROC..PT_HIPROC ELF program header
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" arch_elf_pt_proc
.BI "(struct elfhdr *ehdr "  ","
.BI "struct elf_phdr *phdr "  ","

.BI "bool is_interp "  ","
.BI "struct arch_elf_state *state "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "ehdr" 12
The main ELF header
.IP "phdr" 12
The program header to check
.IP "elf" 12
The open ELF file
.IP "is_interp" 12
True if the phdr is from the interpreter of the ELF being
loaded, else false.
.IP "state" 12
Architecture-specific state preserved throughout the process
of loading the ELF.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

suitability for the system. Called once per ELF program header in the
range PT_LOPROC to PT_HIPROC, for both the ELF being loaded and its
interpreter.
