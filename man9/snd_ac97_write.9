.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Writes a value on the given register.  This will invoke the write
callback directly after the register check.
This function doesn't change the register cache unlike
#\fBsnd_ca97_write_cache\fP, so use this only when you don't want to
reflect the change to the suspend/resume state.
