.SH NAME
device_init_wakeup \- Device wakeup initialization.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" device_init_wakeup
.BI "(struct device *dev "  ","
.BI "bool enable "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dev" 12
Device to handle.
.IP "enable" 12
Whether or not to enable \fIdev\fP as a wakeup device.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
By default, most devices should leave wakeup disabled.  The exceptions are
devices that everyone expects to be wakeup sources: keyboards, power buttons,
possibly network interfaces, etc.  Also, devices that don't generate their
own wakeup requests but merely forward requests from one bus to another
(like PCI bridges) should have wakeup enabled by default.
