.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Call this function to state that the given lock manager is ready to
resume regular locking.  The grace period will not end until all lock
managers that called \fBlocks_start_grace\fP also call \fBlocks_end_grace\fP.
Note that callers count on it being safe to call this more than once,
and the second call should be a no-op.
