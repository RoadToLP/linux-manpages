.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Notifies listeners that all cpus in a power domain are entering a low power
state that may cause some blocks in the same power domain to reset.

Must be called after cpu_pm_enter has been called on all cpus in the power
domain, and before cpu_pm_exit has been called on any cpu in the power
domain. Notified drivers can include VFP co-processor, interrupt controller
and its PM extensions, local CPU timers context save/restore which
shouldn't be interrupted. Hence it must be called with interrupts disabled.

Must be called with interrupts disabled.

Return conditions are same as __raw_notifier_call_chain.
