.BI "(struct device *dev "  ","
.BI "struct device_driver *drv "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dev" 12

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Platform device IDs are assumed to be encoded like this:
"<name><instance>", where <name> is a short description of the type of
device, like "pci" or "floppy", and <instance> is the enumerated
instance of the device, like '0' or '42'.  Driver IDs are simply
"<name>".  So, extract the <name> from the platform_device structure,
and compare it against the name of the driver. Return whether they match
or not.
