.SH NAME
_dpu_encoder_kickoff_phys \- handle physical encoder kickoff Iterate through the physical encoders and perform consolidated flush and/or control start triggering as needed. This is done in the virtual encoder rather than the individual physical ones in order to handle use cases that require visibility into multiple physical encoders at a time.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" _dpu_encoder_kickoff_phys
