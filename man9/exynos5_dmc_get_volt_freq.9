.SH NAME
exynos5_dmc_get_volt_freq \- Gets the frequency and voltage from the OPP table.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" exynos5_dmc_get_volt_freq
.BI "(struct exynos5_dmc *dmc "  ","
.BI "unsigned long *freq "  ","
.BI "unsigned long *target_rate "  ","
.BI "unsigned long *target_volt "  ","
.BI "u32 flags "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dmc" 12
device for which the frequency is going to be changed
.IP "freq" 12
requested frequency in KHz
.IP "target_rate" 12
returned frequency which is the same or lower than
requested
.IP "target_volt" 12
returned voltage which corresponds to the returned
frequency
.IP "flags" 12
devfreq flags provided for this frequency change request
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Function gets requested frequency and checks OPP framework for needed
frequency and voltage. It populates the values 'target_rate' and
'target_volt' or returns error value when OPP framework fails.
