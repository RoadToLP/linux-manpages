.SH NAME
mem_cgroup_iter \- iterate over memory cgroup hierarchy
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "struct mem_cgroup *" mem_cgroup_iter
.BI "(struct mem_cgroup *root "  ","
.BI "struct mem_cgroup *prev "  ","
.BI "struct mem_cgroup_reclaim_cookie *reclaim "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "root" 12
hierarchy root
.IP "prev" 12
previously returned memcg, NULL on first invocation
.IP "reclaim" 12
cookie for shared reclaim walks, NULL for full walks
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Returns references to children of the hierarchy below \fIroot\fP, or
\fIroot\fP itself, or NULL after a full round-trip.

Caller must pass the return value in \fIprev\fP on subsequent
invocations for reference counting, or use \fBmem_cgroup_iter_break\fP
to cancel a hierarchy walk before the round-trip is complete.

Reclaimers can specify a node in \fIreclaim\fP to divide up the memcgs
in the hierarchy among all concurrent reclaimers operating on the
same node.
