.SH NAME
clear_tasks_mm_cpumask \- Safely clear tasks' mm_cpumask for a CPU
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" clear_tasks_mm_cpumask
.BI "(int cpu "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "cpu" 12
a CPU id
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function walks all processes, finds a valid mm struct for each one and
then clears a corresponding bit in mm's cpumask.  While this all sounds
trivial, there are various non-obvious corner cases, which this function
tries to solve in a safe manner.

Also note that the function uses a somewhat relaxed locking scheme, so it may
be called only for an already offlined CPU.
