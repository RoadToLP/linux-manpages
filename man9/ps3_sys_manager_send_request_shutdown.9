.SH "DESCRIPTION"

The guest sends this message to request an operation or action of the system
manager.  The reply is a command message from the system manager.  In the
command handler the guest performs the requested operation.  The result of
the command is then communicated back to the system manager with a response
message.

Currently, the only supported request is the 'shutdown self' request.
