.SH NAME
drm_gem_prime_import_dev \- core implementation of the import callback
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "struct drm_gem_object *" drm_gem_prime_import_dev
.BI "(struct drm_device *dev "  ","
.BI "struct dma_buf *dma_buf "  ","
.BI "struct device *attach_dev "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dev" 12
drm_device to import into
.IP "dma_buf" 12
dma-buf object to import
.IP "attach_dev" 12
struct device to dma_buf attach
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This is the core of \fBdrm_gem_prime_import\fP. It's designed to be called by
drivers who want to use a different device structure than \fIdrm_device.dev\fP for
attaching via dma_buf. This function calls
\fIdrm_driver.gem_prime_import_sg_table\fP internally.

Drivers must arrange to call \fBdrm_prime_gem_destroy\fP from their
\fIdrm_gem_object_funcs.free\fP hook when using this function.
