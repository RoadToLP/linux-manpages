.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "rq" 12
the request to be setup
.IP "rq_src" 12
original request to be cloned
.IP "bs" 12
bio_set that bios for clone are allocated from
.IP "gfp_mask" 12
memory allocation mask for bio
.IP "bio_ctr" 12
setup function to be called for each clone bio.
Returns 0 for success, non 0 for failure.
.IP "data" 12

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Clones bios in \fIrq_src\fP to \fIrq\fP, and copies attributes of \fIrq_src\fP to \fIrq\fP.
Also, pages which the original bios are pointing to are not copied
and the cloned bios just point same pages.
So cloned bios must be completed before original bios, which means
the caller must complete \fIrq\fP before \fIrq_src\fP.
