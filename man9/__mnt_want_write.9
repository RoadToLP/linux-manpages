the mount on which to take a write
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This tells the low-level filesystem that a write is about to be performed to
it, and makes sure that writes are allowed (mnt it read-write) before
returning success. This operation does not protect against filesystem being
frozen. When the write operation is finished, \fB__mnt_drop_write\fP must be
called. This is effectively a refcount.
