.SH "DESCRIPTION"
We enable DFS support upstream on chipsets which have passed a series
of tests. The testing requirements are going to be documented. Desired
test requirements are documented at:

https://wireless.wiki.kernel.org/en/users/Drivers/ath9k/dfs

Once a new chipset gets properly tested an individual commit can be used
to document the testing for DFS for that chipset.
