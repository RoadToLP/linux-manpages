This function looks up and reads node with key \fIkey\fP. The caller has to make
sure the \fInode\fP buffer is large enough to fit the node. Returns zero in case
of success, -ENOENT if the node was not found, and a negative error code in
case of failure. The node location can be returned in \fIlnum\fP and \fIoffs\fP.
