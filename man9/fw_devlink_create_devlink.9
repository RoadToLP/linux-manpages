.SH "DESCRIPTION"

This function will try to create a device link between the consumer device
\fIcon\fP and the supplier device represented by \fIsup_handle\fP.

The supplier has to be provided as a fwnode because incorrect cycles in
fwnode links can sometimes cause the supplier device to never be created.
This function detects such cases and returns an error if it cannot create a
device link from the consumer to a missing supplier.

Returns,
0 on successfully creating a device link
-EINVAL if the device link cannot be created as expected
-EAGAIN if the device link cannot be created right now, but it may be
possible to do that in the future
