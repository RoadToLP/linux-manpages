.SH ARGUMENTS

maximum timeout to wait for oom victims in jiffies
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Forces all page allocations to fail rather than trigger OOM killer.
Will block and wait until all OOM victims are killed or the given
timeout expires.

The function cannot be called when there are runnable user tasks because
the userspace would see unexpected allocation failures as a result. Any
new usage of this function should be consulted with MM people.

Returns true if successful and false if the OOM killer cannot be
disabled.
