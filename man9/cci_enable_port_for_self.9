.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Enabling a CCI port for the calling CPU implies enabling the CCI
port controlling that CPU's cluster. Caller must make sure that the
CPU running the code is the first active CPU in the cluster and all
other CPUs are quiescent in a low power state  or waiting for this CPU
to complete the CCI initialization.

Because this is called when the MMU is still off and with no stack,
the code must be position independent and ideally rely on callee
clobbered registers only.  To achieve this we must code this function
entirely in assembler.

On success this returns with the proper CCI port enabled.  In case of
any failure this never returns as the inability to enable the CCI is
fatal and there is no possible recovery at this stage.
