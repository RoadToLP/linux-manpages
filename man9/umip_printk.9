.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Print the text contained in \fIfmt\fP. The print rate is limited to bursts of 5
messages every two minutes. The purpose of this customized version of
\fBprintk\fP is to print messages when user space processes use any of the
UMIP-protected instructions. Thus, the printed text is prepended with the
task name and process ID number of the current task as well as the
instruction and stack pointers in \fIregs\fP as seen when entering kernel mode.

None.
