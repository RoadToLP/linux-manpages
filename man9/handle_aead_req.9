.SH NAME
handle_aead_req \- Submit a SPU request message for the next chunk of the current AEAD request.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" handle_aead_req
.BI "(struct iproc_reqctx_s *rctx "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "rctx" 12
Crypto request context
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Unlike other operation types, we assume the length of the request fits in
a single SPU request message. \fBaead_enqueue\fP makes sure this is true.
Comments for other op types regarding threads applies here as well.

Unlike incremental hash ops, where the spu returns the entire hash for
truncated algs like sha-224, the SPU returns just the truncated hash in
response to aead requests. So digestsize is always ctx->digestsize here.
.SH "RETURN"
-EINPROGRESS: crypto request has been accepted and result will be
returned asynchronously
Any other value indicates an error
