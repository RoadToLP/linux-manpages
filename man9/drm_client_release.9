.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" drm_client_release
.BI "(struct drm_client_dev *client "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS

DRM client
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Releases resources by closing the \fIdrm_file\fP that was opened by \fBdrm_client_init\fP.
It is called automatically if the \fIdrm_client_funcs.unregister\fP callback is _not_ set.

This function should only be called from the unregister callback. An exception
is fbdev which cannot free the buffer if userspace has open file descriptors.
.SH "NOTE"
Clients cannot initiate a release by themselves. This is done to keep the code simple.
The driver has to be unloaded before the client can be unloaded.
