.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Obtain a file reference from a lookup structure that doesn't refcount
the file, but synchronizes with its release method to make sure it has
not been freed yet. See for example kref_get_unless_zero documentation.
Returns true if refcounting succeeds, false otherwise.

Nobody really wants this as a public API yet, so let it mature here
for some time...
