.SH "DESCRIPTION"
wake_const_ops must be called after a semaphore in a semaphore array
was set to 0. If complex const operations are pending, wake_const_ops must
be called with semnum = -1, as well as with the number of each modified
semaphore.
The tasks that must be woken up are added to \fIwake_q\fP. The return code
is stored in q->pid.
The function returns 1 if at least one operation was completed successfully.
