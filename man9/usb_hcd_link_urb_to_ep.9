.SH NAME
usb_hcd_link_urb_to_ep \- add an URB to its endpoint queue
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" usb_hcd_link_urb_to_ep
.BI "(struct usb_hcd *hcd "  ","
.BI "struct urb *urb "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "hcd" 12
host controller to which \fIurb\fP was submitted
.IP "urb" 12
URB being submitted
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Host controller drivers should call this routine in their \fBenqueue\fP
method.  The HCD's private spinlock must be held and interrupts must
be disabled.  The actions carried out here are required for URB
submission, as well as for endpoint shutdown and for usb_kill_urb.
.SH "RETURN"
0 for no error, otherwise a negative error code (in which case
the \fBenqueue\fP method must fail).  If no error occurs but \fBenqueue\fP fails
anyway, it must call \fBusb_hcd_unlink_urb_from_ep\fP before releasing
the private spinlock and returning.
