.SH NAME
batadv_v_gw_throughput_get \- retrieve the GW-bandwidth for a given GW
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" batadv_v_gw_throughput_get
.BI "(struct batadv_gw_node *gw_node "  ","
.BI "u32 *bw "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gw_node" 12
the GW to retrieve the metric for
.IP "bw" 12
the pointer where the metric will be stored. The metric is computed as
the minimum between the GW advertised throughput and the path throughput to
it in the mesh
.SH "RETURN"
0 on success, -1 on failure
