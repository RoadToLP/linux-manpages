.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "chip" 12
The NAND chip
.IP "buf" 12
buffer used to store the data
.IP "len" 12
length of the buffer
.IP "force_8bit" 12
force 8-bit bus access
.IP "check_only" 12
do not actually run the command, only checks if the
controller driver supports it
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function does a raw data read on the bus. Usually used after launching
another NAND operation like \fBnand_read_page_op\fP.
