.SH "DESCRIPTION"

The vmap/vmalloc layer lazily flushes kernel virtual mappings primarily
to amortize TLB flushing overheads. What this means is that any page you
have now, may, in a former life, have been mapped into kernel virtual
address by the vmap layer and so there might be some CPUs with TLB entries
still referencing that page (additional to the regular 1:1 kernel mapping).

vm_unmap_aliases flushes all such lazy mappings. After it returns, we can
be sure that none of the pages we have control over will have any aliases
from the vmap layer.
