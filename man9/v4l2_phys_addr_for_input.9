.SH NAME
v4l2_phys_addr_for_input \- calculate the PA for an input
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "u16" v4l2_phys_addr_for_input
.BI "(u16 phys_addr "  ","
.BI "u8 input "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "phys_addr" 12
the physical address of the parent
.IP "input" 12
the number of the input port, must be between 1 and 15
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function calculates a new physical address based on the input
port number. For example:

PA = 0.0.0.0 and input = 2 becomes 2.0.0.0

PA = 3.0.0.0 and input = 1 becomes 3.1.0.0

PA = 3.2.1.0 and input = 5 becomes 3.2.1.5

PA = 3.2.1.3 and input = 5 becomes f.f.f.f since it maxed out the depth.
.SH "RETURN"
the new physical address or CEC_PHYS_ADDR_INVALID.
