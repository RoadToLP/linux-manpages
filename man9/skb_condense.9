.SH SYNOPSIS

buffer
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Can be used to save memory before skb is added to a busy queue.
If packet has bytes in frags and enough tail room in skb->head,
pull all of them, so that we can free the frags right now and adjust
truesize.
.SH "NOTES"
We do not reallocate skb->head thus can not fail.
Caller must re-evaluate skb->truesize if needed.
