.SH NAME
next_prime_number \- return the next prime number
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "unsigned long" next_prime_number
.BI "(unsigned long x "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "x" 12
the starting point for searching to test
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
A prime number is an integer greater than 1 that is only divisible by
itself and 1.  The set of prime numbers is computed using the Sieve of
Eratoshenes (on finding a prime, all multiples of that prime are removed
from the set) enabling a fast lookup of the next prime number larger than
\fIx\fP. If the sieve fails (memory limitation), the search falls back to using
slow trial-divison, up to the value of ULONG_MAX (which is reported as the
final prime as a sentinel).
.SH "RETURN"
the next prime number larger than \fIx\fP
