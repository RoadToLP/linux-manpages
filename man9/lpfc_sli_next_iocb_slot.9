This function is called with hbalock held and the caller must post the
iocb without releasing the lock. If the caller releases the lock,
iocb slot returned by the function is not guaranteed to be available.
The function returns pointer to the next available iocb slot if there
is available slot in the ring, else it returns NULL.
If the get index of the ring is ahead of the put index, the function
will post an error attention event to the worker thread to take the
HBA to offline state.
