.SH NAME
intel_idle \- Ask the processor to enter the given idle state.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "__cpuidle int" intel_idle
.BI "(struct cpuidle_device *dev "  ","
.BI "struct cpuidle_driver *drv "  ","
.BI "int index "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dev" 12
cpuidle device of the target CPU.
.IP "drv" 12
cpuidle driver (assumed to point to intel_idle_driver).
.IP "index" 12
Target idle state index.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Use the MWAIT instruction to notify the processor that the CPU represented by
\fIdev\fP is idle and it can try to enter the idle state corresponding to \fIindex\fP.

If the local APIC timer is not known to be reliable in the target idle state,
enable one-shot tick broadcasting for the target CPU before executing MWAIT.

Optionally call \fBleave_mm\fP for the target CPU upfront to avoid wakeups due to
flushing user TLBs.

Must be called under \fBlocal_irq_disable\fP.
