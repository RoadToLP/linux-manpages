.SH NAME
gsi_channel_tx_update \- Report completed TX transfers
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" gsi_channel_tx_update
.BI "(struct gsi_channel *channel "  ","
.BI "struct gsi_trans *trans "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "channel" 12
Channel that has completed transmitting packets
.IP "trans" 12
Last transation known to be complete
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Compute the number of transactions and bytes that have been transferred
over a TX channel since the given transaction was committed.  Report this
information to the network stack.

At the time a transaction is committed, we record its channel's
committed transaction and byte counts *in the transaction*.
Completions are signaled by the hardware with an interrupt, and
we can determine the latest completed transaction at that time.

The difference between the byte/transaction count recorded in
the transaction and the count last time we recorded a completion
tells us exactly how much data has been transferred between
completions.

Calling this each time we learn of a newly-completed transaction
allows us to provide accurate information to the network stack
about how much work has been completed by the hardware at a given
point in time.
