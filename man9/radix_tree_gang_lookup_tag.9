.BI "(const struct radix_tree_root *root "  ","
.BI "void **results "  ","
.BI "unsigned long first_index "  ","
.BI "unsigned int max_items "  ","
.BI "unsigned int tag "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "root" 12
radix tree root
.IP "results" 12
where the results of the lookup are placed
.IP "first_index" 12
start the lookup from this key
.IP "max_items" 12
place up to this many items at *results
.IP "tag" 12
the tag index (< RADIX_TREE_MAX_TAGS)

Performs an index-ascending scan of the tree for present items which
have the tag indexed by \fItag\fP set.  Places the items at *\fIresults\fP and
returns the number of items which were placed at *\fIresults\fP.
