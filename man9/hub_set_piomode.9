.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Put the hub into either "PIO conveyor belt" mode or "fire-and-forget" mode.
To do this, we have to make absolutely sure that no PIOs are in progress
so we turn off access to all widgets for the duration of the function.

XXX - This code should really check what kind of widget we're talking
to.  Bridges can only handle three requests, but XG will do more.
How many can crossbow handle to widget 0?  We're assuming 1.

XXX - There is a bug in the crossbow that link reset PIOs do not
return write responses.  The easiest solution to this problem is to
leave widget 0 (xbow) in fire-and-forget mode at all times.  This
only affects pio's to xbow registers, which should be rare.
