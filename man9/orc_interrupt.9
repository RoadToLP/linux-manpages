Host causing the interrupt

This function is called from the IRQ handler and protected
by the host lock. While the controller reports that there are
scb's for processing we pull them off the controller, turn the
index into a host address pointer to the scb and call the scb
handler.

Returns IRQ_HANDLED if any SCBs were processed, IRQ_NONE otherwise
