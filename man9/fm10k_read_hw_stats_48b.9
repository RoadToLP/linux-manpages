.SH NAME
fm10k_read_hw_stats_48b \- Reads value of 48-bit registers
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "u64" fm10k_read_hw_stats_48b
.BI "(struct fm10k_hw *hw "  ","
.BI "u32 addr "  ","
.BI "struct fm10k_hw_stat *stat "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "hw" 12
pointer to the hardware structure
.IP "addr" 12
address of register containing the lower 32-bit value
.IP "stat" 12
pointer to structure holding hw stat information

Function reads the content of 2 registers, combined to represent a 48-bit
statistical value. Extra processing is required to handle overflowing.
Finally, a delta value is returned representing the difference between the
values stored in registers and values stored in the statistic counters.
