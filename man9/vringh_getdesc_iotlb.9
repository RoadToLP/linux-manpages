.SH NAME
vringh_getdesc_iotlb \- get next available descriptor from ring with IOTLB.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" vringh_getdesc_iotlb
.BI "(struct vringh *vrh "  ","
.BI "struct vringh_kiov *riov "  ","
.BI "struct vringh_kiov *wiov "  ","
.BI "u16 *head "  ","
.BI "gfp_t gfp "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "vrh" 12
the kernelspace vring.
.IP "riov" 12
where to put the readable descriptors (or NULL)
.IP "wiov" 12
where to put the writable descriptors (or NULL)
.IP "head" 12
head index we received, for passing to \fBvringh_complete_iotlb\fP.
.IP "gfp" 12
flags for allocating larger riov/wiov.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Returns 0 if there was no descriptor, 1 if there was, or -errno.

Note that on error return, you can tell the difference between an
invalid ring and a single invalid descriptor: in the former case,
*head will be vrh->vring.num.  You may be able to ignore an invalid
descriptor, but there's not much you can do with an invalid ring.

Note that you may need to clean up riov and wiov, even on error!
