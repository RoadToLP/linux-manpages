On which CPUs the bits should be removed
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Can be called for offline CPUs

This removes not allocated managed interrupts from the map. It does
not matter which one because the managed interrupts free their
allocation when they shut down. If not, the accounting is screwed,
but all what can be done at this point is warn about it.
