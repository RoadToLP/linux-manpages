.SH NAME
i915_gem_object_do_bit_17_swizzle \- fixup bit 17 swizzling
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" i915_gem_object_do_bit_17_swizzle
.BI "(struct drm_i915_gem_object *obj "  ","
.BI "struct sg_table *pages "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "obj" 12
i915 GEM buffer object
.IP "pages" 12
the scattergather list of physical pages
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function fixes up the swizzling in case any page frame number for this
object has changed in bit 17 since that state has been saved with
\fBi915_gem_object_save_bit_17_swizzle\fP.

This is called when pinning backing storage again, since the kernel is free
to move unpinned backing storage around (either by directly moving pages or
by swapping them out and back in again).
