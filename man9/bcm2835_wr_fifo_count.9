bytes to write to TX FIFO
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The caller must ensure that \fIbs->tx_len\fP is greater than or equal to \fIcount\fP,
that the TX FIFO can accommodate \fIcount\fP bytes and that the DMA Enable flag
in the CS register is set (such that a write to the FIFO register transmits
32-bit instead of just 8-bit).
