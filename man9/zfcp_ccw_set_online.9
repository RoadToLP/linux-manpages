.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function gets called by the common i/o layer and sets an
adapter into state online.  The first call will allocate all
adapter resources that will be retained until the device is removed
via zfcp_ccw_remove.

Setting an fcp device online means that it will be registered with
the SCSI stack, that the QDIO queues will be set up and that the
adapter will be opened.
