sba_search_bitmap \- find free space in IO PDIR resource bitmap
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "SBA_INLINE unsigned long" sba_search_bitmap
.BI "(struct ioc *ioc "  ","
.BI "struct device *dev "  ","
.BI "unsigned long bits_wanted "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "ioc" 12
IO MMU structure which owns the pdir we are interested in.
.IP "dev" 12
-- undescribed --
.IP "bits_wanted" 12
number of entries we need.

Find consecutive free bits in resource bitmap.
Each bit represents one entry in the IO Pdir.
Cool perf optimization: search for log2(size) bits at a time.
