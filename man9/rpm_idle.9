.SH NAME
rpm_idle \- Notify device bus type if the device can be suspended.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" rpm_idle
.BI "(struct device *dev "  ","
.BI "int rpmflags "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dev" 12
Device to notify the bus type about.
.IP "rpmflags" 12
Flag bits.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Check if the device's runtime PM status allows it to be suspended.  If
another idle notification has been started earlier, return immediately.  If
the RPM_ASYNC flag is set then queue an idle-notification request; otherwise
run the ->\fBruntime_idle\fP callback directly. If the ->runtime_idle callback
doesn't exist or if it returns 0, call rpm_suspend with the RPM_AUTO flag.

This function must be called under dev->power.lock with interrupts disabled.
