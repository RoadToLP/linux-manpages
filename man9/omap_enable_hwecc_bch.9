.SH NAME
omap_enable_hwecc_bch \- Program GPMC to perform BCH ECC calculation
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void __maybe_unused" omap_enable_hwecc_bch
.BI "(struct nand_chip *chip "  ","
.BI "int mode "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "chip" 12
NAND chip object
.IP "mode" 12
Read/Write mode
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
When using BCH with SW correction (i.e. no ELM), sector size is set
to 512 bytes and we use BCH_WRAPMODE_6 wrapping mode
for both reading and writing with:
eccsize0 = 0  (no additional protected byte in spare area)
eccsize1 = 32 (skip 32 nibbles = 16 bytes per sector in spare area)
