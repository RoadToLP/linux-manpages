.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Some settings are not handled on initvals, e.g. bwmode
settings, some phy settings, workarounds etc that in general
don't fit anywhere else or are too small to introduce a separate
function for each one. So we have this function to handle
them all during reset and complete card's initialization.
