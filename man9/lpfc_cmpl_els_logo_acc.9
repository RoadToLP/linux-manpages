.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This routine is the completion callback function to the Logout (LOGO)
Accept (ACC) Response ELS command. This routine is invoked to indicate
the completion of the LOGO process. It invokes the \fBlpfc_nlp_not_used\fP to
release the ndlp if it has the last reference remaining (reference count
is 1). If succeeded (meaning ndlp released), it sets the IOCB context1
field to NULL to inform the following \fBlpfc_els_free_iocb\fP routine no
ndlp reference count needs to be decremented. Otherwise, the ndlp
reference use-count shall be decremented by the \fBlpfc_els_free_iocb\fP
routine. Finally, the \fBlpfc_els_free_iocb\fP is invoked to release the
IOCB data structure.
