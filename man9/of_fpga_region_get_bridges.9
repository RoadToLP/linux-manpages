.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Create a list of bridges including the parent bridge and the bridges
specified by "fpga-bridges" property.  Note that the
fpga_bridges_enable/disable/put functions are all fine with an empty list
if that happens.

Caller should call fpga_bridges_put(\fIregion->bridge_list\fP) when
done with the bridges.

Return 0 for success (even if there are no bridges specified)
or -EBUSY if any of the bridges are in use.
