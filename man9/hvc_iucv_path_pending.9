.SH NAME
hvc_iucv_path_pending \- IUCV handler to process a connection request.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" hvc_iucv_path_pending
.BI "(struct iucv_path *path "  ","
.BI "u8 *ipvmid "  ","
.BI "u8 *ipuser "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "path" 12
Pending path (struct iucv_path)
.IP "ipvmid" 12
z/VM system identifier of originator
.IP "ipuser" 12
User specified data for this path
(AF_IUCV: port/service name and originator port)
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The function uses the \fIipuser\fP data to determine if the pending path belongs
to a terminal managed by this device driver.
If the path belongs to this driver, ensure that the terminal is not accessed
multiple times (only one connection to a terminal is allowed).
If the terminal is not yet connected, the pending path is accepted and is
associated to the appropriate struct hvc_iucv_private instance.

Returns 0 if \fIpath\fP belongs to a terminal managed by the this device driver;
otherwise returns -ENODEV in order to dispatch this path to other handlers.

Locking:     struct hvc_iucv_private->lock
