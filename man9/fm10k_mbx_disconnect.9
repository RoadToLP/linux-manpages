This function will shut down the mailbox.  It places the mailbox first
in the disconnect state, it then allows up to a predefined timeout for
the mailbox to transition to close on its own.  If this does not occur
then the mailbox will be forced into the closed state.

Any mailbox transactions not completed before calling this function
are not guaranteed to complete and may be dropped.
