.SH NAME
rdtgroup_pseudo_lock_remove \- Remove a pseudo-locked region
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" rdtgroup_pseudo_lock_remove
.BI "(struct rdtgroup *rdtgrp "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "rdtgrp" 12
resource group to which the pseudo-locked region belongs
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The removal of a pseudo-locked region can be initiated when the resource
group is removed from user space via a "rmdir" from userspace or the
unmount of the resctrl filesystem. On removal the resource group does
not go back to pseudo-locksetup mode before it is removed, instead it is
removed directly. There is thus assymmetry with the creation where the
\fIstruct pseudo_lock_region\fP is removed here while it was not created in
\fBrdtgroup_pseudo_lock_create\fP.
.SH "RETURN"
