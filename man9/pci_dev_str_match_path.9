.SH NAME
pci_dev_str_match_path \- test if a path string matches a device
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" pci_dev_str_match_path
.BI "(struct pci_dev *dev "  ","
.BI "const char *path "  ","
.BI "const char **endptr "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dev" 12
the PCI device to test
.IP "path" 12
string to match the device against
.IP "endptr" 12
pointer to the string after the match
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Test if a string (typically from a kernel parameter) formatted as a
path of device/function addresses matches a PCI device. The string must
be of the form:

[<domain>:]<bus>:<device>.<func>[/<device>.<func>]*

A path for a device can be obtained using 'lspci -t'.  Using a path
is more robust against bus renumbering than using only a single bus,
device and function address.

Returns 1 if the string matches the device, 0 if it does not and
a negative error code if it fails to parse the string.
