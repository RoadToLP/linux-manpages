.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Reset the states of the mem_cgroup associated with \fIcss\fP.  This is
invoked when the userland requests disabling on the default hierarchy
but the memcg is pinned through dependency.  The memcg should stop
applying policies and should revert to the vanilla state as it may be
made visible again.

The current implementation only resets the essential configurations.
This needs to be expanded to cover all the visible parts.
