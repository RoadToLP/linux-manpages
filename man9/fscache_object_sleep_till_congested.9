.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Allow an object handler to sleep until the object workqueue is congested.

The caller must set up a wake up event before calling this and must have set
the appropriate sleep mode (such as TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE) and tested its own
condition before calling this function as no test is made here.

true is returned if the object wq is congested, false otherwise.
