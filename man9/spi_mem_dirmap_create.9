.SH NAME
spi_mem_dirmap_create \- Create a direct mapping descriptor
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "struct spi_mem_dirmap_desc *" spi_mem_dirmap_create
.BI "(struct spi_mem *mem "  ","
.BI "const struct spi_mem_dirmap_info *info "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "mem" 12
SPI mem device this direct mapping should be created for
.IP "info" 12
direct mapping information
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function is creating a direct mapping descriptor which can then be used
to access the memory using \fBspi_mem_dirmap_read\fP or \fBspi_mem_dirmap_write\fP.
If the SPI controller driver does not support direct mapping, this function
falls back to an implementation using \fBspi_mem_exec_op\fP, so that the caller
doesn't have to bother implementing a fallback on his own.
.SH "RETURN"
a valid pointer in case of success, and \fBERR_PTR\fP otherwise.
