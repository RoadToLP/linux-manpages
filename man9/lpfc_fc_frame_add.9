.SH NAME
lpfc_fc_frame_add \- Adds a frame to the vport's list of received sequences
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "struct hbq_dmabuf *" lpfc_fc_frame_add
.BI "(struct lpfc_vport *vport "  ","
.BI "struct hbq_dmabuf *dmabuf "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "vport" 12
pointer to a vitural port
.IP "dmabuf" 12
pointer to a dmabuf that describes the hdr and data of the FC frame
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function searches through the existing incomplete sequences that have
been sent to this \fIvport\fP. If the frame matches one of the incomplete
sequences then the dbuf in the \fIdmabuf\fP is added to the list of frames that
make up that sequence. If no sequence is found that matches this frame then
the function will add the hbuf in the \fIdmabuf\fP to the \fIvport\fP's rcv_buffer_list
This function returns a pointer to the first dmabuf in the sequence list that
the frame was linked to.
