.SH NAME
lpfc_cmpl_els_flogi_nport \- Completion function for flogi to an N_Port
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" lpfc_cmpl_els_flogi_nport
.BI "(struct lpfc_vport *vport "  ","
.BI "struct lpfc_nodelist *ndlp "  ","
.BI "struct serv_parm *sp "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "vport" 12
pointer to a host virtual N_Port data structure.
.IP "ndlp" 12
pointer to a node-list data structure.
.IP "sp" 12
pointer to service parameter data structure.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This routine is invoked by the \fBlpfc_cmpl_els_flogi\fP completion callback
function to handle the completion of a Fabric Login (FLOGI) into an N_Port
in a point-to-point topology. First, the \fIvport\fP's N_Port Name is compared
with the received N_Port Name: if the \fIvport\fP's N_Port Name is greater than
the received N_Port Name lexicographically, this node shall assign local
N_Port ID (PT2PT_LocalID: 1) and remote N_Port ID (PT2PT_RemoteID: 2) and
will send out Port Login (PLOGI) with the N_Port IDs assigned. Otherwise,
this node shall just wait for the remote node to issue PLOGI and assign
N_Port IDs.
