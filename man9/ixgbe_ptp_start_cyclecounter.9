This function should be called to set the proper values for the TIMINCA
register and tell the cyclecounter structure what the tick rate of SYSTIME
is. It does not directly modify SYSTIME registers or the timecounter
structure. It should be called whenever a new TIMINCA value is necessary,
such as during initialization or when the link speed changes.
