.SH NAME
usb_driver_set_configuration \- Provide a way for drivers to change device configurations
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" usb_driver_set_configuration
.BI "(struct usb_device *udev "  ","
.BI "int config "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "udev" 12
the device whose configuration is being updated
.IP "config" 12
the configuration being chosen.
.SH "CONTEXT"
In process context, must be able to sleep
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Device interface drivers are not allowed to change device configurations.
This is because changing configurations will destroy the interface the
driver is bound to and create new ones; it would be like a floppy-disk
driver telling the computer to replace the floppy-disk drive with a
tape drive!

Still, in certain specialized circumstances the need may arise.  This
routine gets around the normal restrictions by using a work thread to
submit the change-config request.
.SH "RETURN"
0 if the request was successfully queued, error code otherwise.
The caller has no way to know whether the queued request will eventually
succeed.
