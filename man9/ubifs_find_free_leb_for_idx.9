.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function looks for a free LEB and returns that LEB number. The returned
LEB is marked as "taken", "index".

Only empty LEBs are allocated. This is for two reasons. First, the commit
calculates the number of LEBs to allocate based on the assumption that they
will be empty. Secondly, free space at the end of an index LEB is not
guaranteed to be empty because it may have been used by the in-the-gaps
method prior to an unclean unmount.

If no LEB is found -ENOSPC is returned. For other failures another negative
error code is returned.
