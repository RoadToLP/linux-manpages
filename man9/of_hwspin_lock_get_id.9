.SH NAME
of_hwspin_lock_get_id \- get lock id for an OF phandle-based specific lock
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" of_hwspin_lock_get_id
.BI "(struct device_node *np "  ","
.BI "int index "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "np" 12
device node from which to request the specific hwlock
.IP "index" 12
index of the hwlock in the list of values
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function provides a means for DT users of the hwspinlock module to
get the global lock id of a specific hwspinlock using the phandle of the
hwspinlock device, so that it can be requested using the normal
\fBhwspin_lock_request_specific\fP API.

Returns the global lock id number on success, -EPROBE_DEFER if the hwspinlock
device is not yet registered, -EINVAL on invalid args specifier value or an
appropriate error as returned from the OF parsing of the DT client node.
