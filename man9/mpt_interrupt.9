This routine is registered via the \fBrequest_irq\fP kernel API call,
and handles all interrupts generated from a specific MPT adapter
(also referred to as a IO Controller or IOC).
This routine must clear the interrupt from the adapter and does
so by reading the reply FIFO.  Multiple replies may be processed
per single call to this routine.

This routine handles register-level access of the adapter but
dispatches (calls) a protocol-specific callback routine to handle
the protocol-specific details of the MPT request completion.
