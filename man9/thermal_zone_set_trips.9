.SH NAME
thermal_zone_set_trips \- Computes the next trip points for the driver
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" thermal_zone_set_trips
.BI "(struct thermal_zone_device *tz "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "tz" 12
a pointer to a thermal zone device structure
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The function computes the next temperature boundaries by browsing
the trip points. The result is the closer low and high trip points
to the current temperature. These values are passed to the backend
driver to let it set its own notification mechanism (usually an
interrupt).

It does not return a value
