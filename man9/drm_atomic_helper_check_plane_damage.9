.SH NAME
drm_atomic_helper_check_plane_damage \- Verify plane damage on atomic_check.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" drm_atomic_helper_check_plane_damage
.BI "(struct drm_atomic_state *state "  ","
.BI "struct drm_plane_state *plane_state "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "state" 12
The driver state object.
.IP "plane_state" 12
Plane state for which to verify damage.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This helper function makes sure that damage from plane state is discarded
for full modeset. If there are more reasons a driver would want to do a full
plane update rather than processing individual damage regions, then those
cases should be taken care of here.

Note that \fIdrm_plane_state.fb_damage_clips\fP == NULL in plane state means that
full plane update should happen. It also ensure helper iterator will return
\fIdrm_plane_state.src\fP as damage.
