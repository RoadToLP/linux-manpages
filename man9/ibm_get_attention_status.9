.SH NAME
ibm_get_attention_status \- callback method to get attention LED status
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" ibm_get_attention_status
.BI "(struct hotplug_slot *slot "  ","
.BI "u8 *status "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "slot" 12
the hotplug_slot to work with
.IP "status" 12
returns what the LED is set to (0 or 1)
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This method is registered with the acpiphp module as a
callback to do the device specific task of getting the LED status.

Because there is no direct method of getting the LED status directly
from an ACPI call, we read the aPCI table and parse out our
slot descriptor to read the status from that.
