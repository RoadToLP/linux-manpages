.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The buffers pointed to by buf and query may overlap. The query buffer is
parsed before buf is written to.

The query should look like "LABEL_NAME\0DFA_STRING" where LABEL_NAME is
the name of the label, in the current namespace, that is to be queried and
DFA_STRING is a binary string to match against the label(s)'s DFA.

LABEL_NAME must be NUL terminated. DFA_STRING may contain NUL characters
but must *not* be NUL terminated.
.SH "RETURN"
number of characters written to buf or -errno on failure
