.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Parse an EFI signature list looking for elements of interest.  A list is
made up of a series of sublists, where all the elements in a sublist are of
the same type, but sublists can be of different types.

For each sublist encountered, the \fIget_handler_for_guid\fP function is called
with the type specifier GUID and returns either a pointer to a function to
handle elements of that type or NULL if the type is not of interest.

If the sublist is of interest, each element is passed to the handler
function in turn.

Error EBADMSG is returned if the list doesn't parse correctly and 0 is
returned if the list was parsed correctly.  No error can be returned from
the \fIget_handler_for_guid\fP function or the element handler function it
returns.
