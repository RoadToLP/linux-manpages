.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This routine is a callback routine to read a scancode filter value or mask.
It is triggered by reading /sys/class/rc/rc?/[wakeup_]filter[_mask].
It prints the current scancode filter value or mask of the appropriate filter
type in hexadecimal into \fIbuf\fP and returns the size of the buffer.

Bits of the filter value corresponding to set bits in the filter mask are
compared against input scancodes and non-matching scancodes are discarded.

dev->lock is taken to guard against races between
store_filter and show_filter.
