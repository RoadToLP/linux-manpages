.SH "DESCRIPTION"
"Bus Relations" is the Windows term for "children of this
bus."  The terminology is preserved here for people trying to
debug the interaction between Hyper-V and Linux.  This
function is called when the parent partition reports a list
of functions that should be observed under this PCI Express
port (bus).

This function updates the list, and must tolerate being
called multiple times with the same information.  The typical
number of child devices is one, with very atypical cases
involving three or four, so the algorithms used here can be
simple and inefficient.

It must also treat the omission of a previously observed device as
notification that the device no longer exists.

Note that this function is serialized with \fBhv_eject_device_work\fP,
because both are pushed to the ordered workqueue hbus->wq.
