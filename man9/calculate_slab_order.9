calculate_slab_order \- calculate size (page order) of slabs
.SH SYNOPSIS

.BI "(struct kmem_cache *cachep "  ","
.BI "size_t size "  ","
.BI "slab_flags_t flags "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "cachep" 12
pointer to the cache that is being created
.IP "size" 12
size of objects to be created in this cache.
.IP "flags" 12
slab allocation flags
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Also calculates the number of objects per slab.

This could be made much more intelligent.  For now, try to avoid using
high order pages for slabs.  When the \fBgfp\fP functions are more friendly
towards high-order requests, this should be changed.
.SH "RETURN"
number of left-over bytes in a slab
