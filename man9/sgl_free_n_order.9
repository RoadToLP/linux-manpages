.SH NAME
sgl_free_n_order \- free a scatterlist and its pages
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" sgl_free_n_order
.BI "(struct scatterlist *sgl "  ","
.BI "int nents "  ","
.BI "int order "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "sgl" 12
Scatterlist with one or more elements
.IP "nents" 12
Maximum number of elements to free
.IP "order" 12
Second argument for \fB__free_pages\fP
.SH "NOTES"
- If several scatterlists have been chained and each chain element is
freed separately then it's essential to set nents correctly to avoid that a
page would get freed twice.
- All pages in a chained scatterlist can be freed at once by setting \fInents\fP
to a high number.
