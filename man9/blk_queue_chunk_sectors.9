.SH "DESCRIPTION"
If a driver doesn't want IOs to cross a given chunk size, it can set
this limit and prevent merging across chunks. Note that the block layer
must accept a page worth of data at any offset. So if the crossing of
chunks is a hard limitation in the driver, it must still be prepared
to split single page bios.
