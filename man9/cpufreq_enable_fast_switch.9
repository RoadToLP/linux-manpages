.SH NAME
cpufreq_enable_fast_switch \- Enable fast frequency switching for policy.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" cpufreq_enable_fast_switch
.BI "(struct cpufreq_policy *policy "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "policy" 12
cpufreq policy to enable fast frequency switching for.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Try to enable fast frequency switching for \fIpolicy\fP.

The attempt will fail if there is at least one transition notifier registered
at this point, as fast frequency switching is quite fundamentally at odds
with transition notifiers.  Thus if successful, it will make registration of
transition notifiers fail going forward.
