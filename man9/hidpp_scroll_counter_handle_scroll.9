.SH NAME
hidpp_scroll_counter_handle_scroll \- Send high- and low-resolution scroll events given a high-resolution wheel movement.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" hidpp_scroll_counter_handle_scroll
.BI "(struct input_dev *input_dev "  ","
.BI "struct hidpp_scroll_counter *counter "  ","
.BI "int hi_res_value "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "input_dev" 12
-- undescribed --
.IP "counter" 12
a hid_scroll_counter struct describing the wheel.
.IP "hi_res_value" 12
the movement of the wheel, in the mouse's high-resolution
units.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Given a high-resolution movement, this function converts the movement into
fractions of 120 and emits high-resolution scroll events for the input
device. It also uses the multiplier from \fIstruct hid_scroll_counter\fP to
emit low-resolution scroll events when appropriate for
backwards-compatibility with userspace input libraries.
