.SH "DESCRIPTION"
We have to trap VFS attempts to truncate the file described by \fIdentry\fP as
soon as possible, because we do not implement changes in i_size yet.  So we
abort all i_size changes here.

We also abort all changes of user, group, and mode as we do not implement
the NTFS ACLs yet.

Called with ->i_mutex held.
