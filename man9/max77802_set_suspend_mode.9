.SH NAME
max77802_set_suspend_mode \- set regulator opmode when the system is suspended
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" max77802_set_suspend_mode
.BI "(struct regulator_dev *rdev "  ","
.BI "unsigned int mode "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "rdev" 12
regulator to change mode
.IP "mode" 12
operating mode to be set
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Will set the operating mode for the regulators during system suspend.
This function is valid for the three different enable control logics:

Enable Control Logic1 by PWRREQ (BUCK 2-4 and LDOs 2, 4-19, 22-35)
Enable Control Logic2 by PWRREQ (LDOs 1, 20, 21)
Enable Control Logic3 by PWRREQ (LDO 3)

If setting the regulator mode fails, the function only warns but does
not return an error code to avoid the regulator core to stop setting
the operating mode for the remaining regulators.
