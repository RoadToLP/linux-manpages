.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function synchronously erases physical eraseblock \fIpnum\fP. If \fItorture\fP
flag is not zero, the physical eraseblock is checked by means of writing
different patterns to it and reading them back. If the torturing is enabled,
the physical eraseblock is erased more than once.

This function returns the number of erasures made in case of success, -EIO
if the erasure failed or the torturing test failed, and other negative error
codes in case of other errors. Note, -EIO means that the physical
eraseblock is bad.
