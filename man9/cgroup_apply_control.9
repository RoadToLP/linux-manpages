.SH "DESCRIPTION"
subsystems can be enabled and disabled in a subtree using the following
steps.

1. Call \fBcgroup_save_control\fP to stash the current state.
2. Update ->subtree_control masks in the subtree as desired.
3. Call \fBcgroup_apply_control\fP to apply the changes.
4. Optionally perform other related operations.
5. Call \fBcgroup_finalize_control\fP to finish up.

This function implements step 3 and propagates the mask changes
throughout \fIcgrp\fP's subtree, updates csses accordingly and perform
process migrations.
