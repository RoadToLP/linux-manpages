tty_unthrottle \- flow control
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" tty_unthrottle
.BI "(struct tty_struct *tty "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "tty" 12
terminal

Indicate that a tty may continue transmitting data down the stack.
Takes the termios rwsem to protect against parallel throttle/unthrottle
and also to ensure the driver can consistently reference its own
termios data at this point when implementing software flow control.

Drivers should however remember that the stack can issue a throttle,
then change flow control method, then unthrottle.
