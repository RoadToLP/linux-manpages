.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dev_priv" 12
i915 device instance
.IP "pipe" 12
(CPU) pipe to set state for
.IP "enable" 12
whether underruns should be reported or not
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function sets the fifo underrun state for \fIpipe\fP. It is used in the
modeset code to avoid false positives since on many platforms underruns are
expected when disabling or enabling the pipe.

Notice that on some platforms disabling underrun reports for one pipe
disables for all due to shared interrupts. Actual reporting is still per-pipe
though.

Returns the previous state of underrun reporting.
