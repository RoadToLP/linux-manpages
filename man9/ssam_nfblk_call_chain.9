.SH NAME
ssam_nfblk_call_chain \- Call event notifier callbacks of the given chain.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" ssam_nfblk_call_chain
.BI "(struct ssam_nf_head *nh "  ","
.BI "struct ssam_event *event "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "nh" 12
The notifier head for which the notifier callbacks should be called.
.IP "event" 12
The event data provided to the callbacks.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Call all registered notifier callbacks in order of their priority until
either no notifier is left or a notifier returns a value with the
SSAM_NOTIF_STOP bit set. Note that this bit is automatically set via
\fBssam_notifier_from_errno\fP on any non-zero error value.
.SH "RETURN"
Returns the notifier status value, which contains the notifier
status bits (SSAM_NOTIF_HANDLED and SSAM_NOTIF_STOP) as well as a
potential error value returned from the last executed notifier callback.
Use \fBssam_notifier_to_errno\fP to convert this value to the original error
value.
