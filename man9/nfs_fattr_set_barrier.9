.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Used to set a barrier after an attribute was updated. This
barrier ensures that older attributes from RPC calls that may
have raced with our update cannot clobber these new values.
Note that you are still responsible for ensuring that other
operations which change the attribute on the server do not
collide.
