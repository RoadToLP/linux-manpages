.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Start DMA transmit for a specific queue and since 5210 doesn't have
QCU/DCU, set up queue parameters for 5210 here based on queue type (one
queue for normal data and one queue for beacons). For queue setup
on newer chips check out qcu.c. Returns -EINVAL if queue number is out
of range or if queue is already disabled.
.SH "NOTE"
Must be called after setting up tx control descriptor for that
queue (see below).
