.SH NAME
drm_kms_helper_hotplug_event \- fire off KMS hotplug events
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" drm_kms_helper_hotplug_event
.BI "(struct drm_device *dev "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dev" 12
drm_device whose connector state changed
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function fires off the uevent for userspace and also calls the
output_poll_changed function, which is most commonly used to inform the fbdev
emulation code and allow it to update the fbcon output configuration.

Drivers should call this from their hotplug handling code when a change is
detected. Note that this function does not do any output detection of its
own, like \fBdrm_helper_hpd_irq_event\fP does - this is assumed to be done by the
driver already.

This function must be called from process context with no mode
setting locks held.
