.SH NAME
cpufreq_driver_fast_switch \- Carry out a fast CPU frequency switch.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "unsigned int" cpufreq_driver_fast_switch
.BI "(struct cpufreq_policy *policy "  ","
.BI "unsigned int target_freq "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "policy" 12
cpufreq policy to switch the frequency for.
.IP "target_freq" 12
New frequency to set (may be approximate).
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Carry out a fast frequency switch without sleeping.

The driver's ->\fBfast_switch\fP callback invoked by this function must be
suitable for being called from within RCU-sched read-side critical sections
and it is expected to select the minimum available frequency greater than or
equal to \fItarget_freq\fP (CPUFREQ_RELATION_L).

This function must not be called if policy->fast_switch_enabled is unset.

Governors calling this function must guarantee that it will never be invoked
twice in parallel for the same policy and that it will never be called in
parallel with either ->\fBtarget\fP or ->\fBtarget_index\fP for the same policy.

Returns the actual frequency set for the CPU.

If 0 is returned by the driver's ->\fBfast_switch\fP callback to indicate an
error condition, the hardware configuration must be preserved.
