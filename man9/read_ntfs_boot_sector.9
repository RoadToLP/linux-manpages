.SH NAME
read_ntfs_boot_sector \- read the NTFS boot sector of a device
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "struct buffer_head *" read_ntfs_boot_sector
.BI "(struct super_block *sb "  ","
.BI "const int silent "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "sb" 12
super block of device to read the boot sector from
.IP "silent" 12
if true, suppress all output
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Reads the boot sector from the device and validates it. If that fails, tries
to read the backup boot sector, first from the end of the device a-la NT4 and
later and then from the middle of the device a-la NT3.51 and before.

If a valid boot sector is found but it is not the primary boot sector, we
repair the primary boot sector silently (unless the device is read-only or
the primary boot sector is not accessible).

Return the unlocked buffer head containing the boot sector or NULL on error.
.SH "NOTE"
To call this function, \fIsb\fP must have the fields s_dev, the ntfs super
block (u.ntfs_sb), nr_blocks and the device flags (s_flags) initialized
to their respective values.
