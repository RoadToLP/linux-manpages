.SH NAME
vsp1_du_setup_lif \- Setup the output part of the VSP pipeline
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" vsp1_du_setup_lif
.BI "(struct device *dev "  ","
.BI "unsigned int pipe_index "  ","
.BI "const struct vsp1_du_lif_config *cfg "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dev" 12
the VSP device
.IP "pipe_index" 12
the DRM pipeline index
.IP "cfg" 12
the LIF configuration
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Configure the output part of VSP DRM pipeline for the given frame \fIcfg.width\fP
and \fIcfg.height\fP. This sets up formats on the BRx source pad, the WPF sink and
source pads, and the LIF sink pad.

The \fIpipe_index\fP argument selects which DRM pipeline to setup. The number of
available pipelines depend on the VSP instance.

As the media bus code on the blend unit source pad is conditioned by the
configuration of its sink 0 pad, we also set up the formats on all blend unit
sinks, even if the configuration will be overwritten later by
\fBvsp1_du_setup_rpf\fP. This ensures that the blend unit configuration is set to
a well defined state.

Return 0 on success or a negative error code on failure.
