Allocate a new \fIsk_buff\fP and assign it a usage count of one. The
buffer has NET_SKB_PAD headroom built in. Users should allocate
the headroom they think they need without accounting for the
built in space. The built in space is used for optimisations.

NULL is returned if there is no free memory.
