.SH NAME
drm_gem_dmabuf_mmap \- dma_buf mmap implementation for GEM
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" drm_gem_dmabuf_mmap
.BI "(struct dma_buf *dma_buf "  ","
.BI "struct vm_area_struct *vma "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dma_buf" 12
buffer to be mapped
.IP "vma" 12
virtual address range
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Provides memory mapping for the buffer. This can be used as the
\fIdma_buf_ops.mmap\fP callback. It just forwards to \fIdrm_driver.gem_prime_mmap\fP,
which should be set to \fBdrm_gem_prime_mmap\fP.

FIXME: There's really no point to this wrapper, drivers which need anything
else but drm_gem_prime_mmap can roll their own \fIdma_buf_ops.mmap\fP callback.

Returns 0 on success or a negative error code on failure.
