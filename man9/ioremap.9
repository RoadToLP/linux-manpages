.SH NAME
ioremap \- map bus memory into CPU space
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void __iomem *" ioremap
.BI "(resource_size_t phys_addr "  ","
.BI "unsigned long size "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "phys_addr" 12
bus address of the memory
.IP "size" 12
size of the resource to map
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
ioremap performs a platform specific sequence of operations to
make bus memory CPU accessible via the readb/readw/readl/writeb/
writew/writel functions and the other mmio helpers. The returned
address is not guaranteed to be usable directly as a virtual
address.

This version of ioremap ensures that the memory is marked uncachable
on the CPU as well as honouring existing caching rules from things like
the PCI bus. Note that there are other caches and buffers on many
busses. In particular driver authors should read up on PCI writes

It's useful if some control registers are in such an area and
write combining or read caching is not desirable:

Must be freed with iounmap.
