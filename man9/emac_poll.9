.SH "DESCRIPTION"
NAPI Poll function implemented to process packets as per budget. We check
the type of interrupt on the device and accordingly call the TX or RX
packet processing functions. We follow the budget for RX processing and
also put a cap on number of TX pkts processed through config param. The
NAPI schedule function is called if more packets pending.

Returns number of packets received (in most cases; else TX pkts - rarely)
