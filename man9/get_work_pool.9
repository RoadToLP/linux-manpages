.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Pools are created and destroyed under wq_pool_mutex, and allows read
access under RCU read lock.  As such, this function should be
called under wq_pool_mutex or inside of a \fBrcu_read_lock\fP region.

All fields of the returned pool are accessible as long as the above
mentioned locking is in effect.  If the returned pool needs to be used
beyond the critical section, the caller is responsible for ensuring the
returned pool is and stays online.
.SH "RETURN"
The worker_pool \fIwork\fP was last associated with.  NULL if none.
