this process _must_ quit (return) as soon as any connection
errors are encountered.  Connection recovery is done elsewhere.
Discover process only interrogates devices in order to discover the
domain.For plugging out, we un-register the device only when it is
the last phy in the port, for other phys in this port, we just delete it
from the port.For inserting, we do discovery when it is the
first phy,for other phys in this port, we add it to the port to
forming the wide-port.
