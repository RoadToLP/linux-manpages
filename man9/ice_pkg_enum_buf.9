.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "struct ice_buf_hdr *" ice_pkg_enum_buf
.BI "(struct ice_seg *ice_seg "  ","
.BI "struct ice_pkg_enum *state "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "ice_seg" 12
pointer to the ice segment (or NULL on subsequent calls)
.IP "state" 12
pointer to the enum state
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function will enumerate all the buffers in the ice segment. The first
call is made with the ice_seg parameter non-NULL; on subsequent calls,
ice_seg is set to NULL which continues the enumeration. When the function
returns a NULL pointer, then the end of the buffers has been reached, or an
unexpected value has been detected (for example an invalid section count or
an invalid buffer end value).
