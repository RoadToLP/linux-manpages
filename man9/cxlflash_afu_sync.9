.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" cxlflash_afu_sync
.BI "(struct afu *afu "  ","
.BI "ctx_hndl_t ctx "  ","

.BI "u8 mode "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "afu" 12
AFU associated with the host.
.IP "ctx" 12
Identifies context requesting sync.
.IP "res" 12
Identifies resource requesting sync.
.IP "mode" 12

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
AFU sync operations are only necessary and allowed when the device is
operating normally. When not operating normally, sync requests can occur as
part of cleaning up resources associated with an adapter prior to removal.
In this scenario, these requests are simply ignored (safe due to the AFU
going away).
.SH "RETURN"
0 on success, -errno on failure
