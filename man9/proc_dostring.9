Reads/writes a string from/to the user buffer. If the kernel
buffer provided is not large enough to hold the string, the
string is truncated. The copied string is NULL-terminated.
If the string is being read by the user process, it is copied
and a newline '\n' is added. It is truncated if the buffer is
not large enough.

Returns 0 on success.
