.SH NAME
atmel_smc_cs_encode_ncycles \- encode a number of MCK clk cycles in the format expected by the SMC engine
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" atmel_smc_cs_encode_ncycles
.BI "(unsigned int ncycles "  ","
.BI "unsigned int msbpos "  ","
.BI "unsigned int msbwidth "  ","
.BI "unsigned int msbfactor "  ","
.BI "unsigned int *encodedval "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "ncycles" 12
number of MCK clk cycles
.IP "msbpos" 12
position of the MSB part of the timing field
.IP "msbwidth" 12
width of the MSB part of the timing field
.IP "msbfactor" 12
factor applied to the MSB
.IP "encodedval" 12
param used to store the encoding result
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function encodes the \fIncycles\fP value as described in the datasheet
(section "SMC Setup/Pulse/Cycle/Timings Register"). This is a generic
helper which called with different parameter depending on the encoding
scheme.

If the \fIncycles\fP value is too big to be encoded, -ERANGE is returned and
the encodedval is contains the maximum val. Otherwise, 0 is returned.
