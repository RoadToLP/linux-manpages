.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "hw" 12
pointer to the HW struct
.IP "blk" 12
hardware block
.IP "id" 12
profile tracking ID
.IP "ptypes" 12
array of bitmaps indicating ptypes (ICE_FLOW_PTYPE_MAX bits)
.IP "es" 12
extraction sequence (length of array is determined by the block)
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function registers a profile, which matches a set of PTGs with a
particular extraction sequence. While the hardware profile is allocated
it will not be written until the first call to ice_add_flow that specifies
the ID value used here.
