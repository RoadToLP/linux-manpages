.SH NAME
dwarf_cfa_execute_insns \- execute instructions to calculate a CFA
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" dwarf_cfa_execute_insns
.BI "(unsigned char *insn_start "  ","
.BI "unsigned char *insn_end "  ","
.BI "struct dwarf_cie *cie "  ","
.BI "struct dwarf_fde *fde "  ","
.BI "struct dwarf_frame *frame "  ","
.BI "unsigned long pc "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "insn_start" 12
address of the first instruction
.IP "insn_end" 12
address of the last instruction
.IP "cie" 12
the CIE for this function
.IP "fde" 12
the FDE for this function
.IP "frame" 12
the instructions calculate the CFA for this frame
.IP "pc" 12
the program counter of the address we're interested in

Execute the Call Frame instruction sequence starting at
\fIinsn_start\fP and ending at \fIinsn_end\fP. The instructions describe
how to calculate the Canonical Frame Address of a stackframe.
Store the results in \fIframe\fP.
