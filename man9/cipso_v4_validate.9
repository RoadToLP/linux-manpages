.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This routine is called to validate a CIPSO option, it checks all of the
fields to ensure that they are at least valid, see the draft snippet below
for details.  If the option is valid then a zero value is returned and
the value of \fIoption\fP is unchanged.  If the option is invalid then a
non-zero value is returned and \fIoption\fP is adjusted to point to the
offending portion of the option.  From the IETF draft ...

"If any field within the CIPSO options, such as the DOI identifier, is not
recognized the IP datagram is discarded and an ICMP 'parameter problem'
(type 12) is generated and returned.  The ICMP code field is set to 'bad
parameter' (code 0) and the pointer is set to the start of the CIPSO field
that is unrecognized."
