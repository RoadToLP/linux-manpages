.SH SYNOPSIS

.BI "(struct device_node *np "  ","
.BI "struct videomode *vm "  ","
.BI "int index "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS

devicenode with the display_timings

.IP "index" 12
index into list of display_timings
(Set this to OF_USE_NATIVE_MODE to use whatever mode is
specified as native mode in the DT.)
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Get a list of all display timings and put the one
specified by index into *vm. This function should only be used, if
only one videomode is to be retrieved. A driver that needs to work
with multiple/all videomodes should work with
of_get_display_timings instead.
