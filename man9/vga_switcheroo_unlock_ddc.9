.SH NAME
vga_switcheroo_unlock_ddc \- switch DDC lines back to previous owner
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" vga_switcheroo_unlock_ddc
.BI "(struct pci_dev *pdev "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "pdev" 12
client pci device
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Switch DDC lines back to the previous owner after calling
\fBvga_switcheroo_lock_ddc\fP. This must be called even if
\fBvga_switcheroo_lock_ddc\fP returned an error.
.SH "RETURN"
Previous DDC owner on success (i.e. the client identifier of \fIpdev\fP)
or a negative int on error.
Specifically, -ENODEV if no handler has registered or if the handler
does not support switching the DDC lines. Also, a negative value
returned by the handler is propagated back to the caller.
Finally, invoking this function without calling \fBvga_switcheroo_lock_ddc\fP
first is not allowed and will result in -EINVAL.
