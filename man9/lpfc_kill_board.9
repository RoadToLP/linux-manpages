.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The kill board mailbox command is used to tell firmware to perform a
graceful shutdown of a channel on a specified board to prepare for reset.
When the kill board mailbox command is received, the ER3 bit is set to 1
in the Host Status register and the ER Attention bit is set to 1 in the
Host Attention register of the HBA function that received the kill board
command.

This routine prepares the mailbox command for killing the board in
preparation for a graceful shutdown.
