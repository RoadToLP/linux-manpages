.SH NAME
dma_fence_remove_callback \- remove a callback from the signaling list
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "bool" dma_fence_remove_callback
.BI "(struct dma_fence *fence "  ","
.BI "struct dma_fence_cb *cb "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "fence" 12
the fence to wait on
.IP "cb" 12
the callback to remove
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Remove a previously queued callback from the fence. This function returns
true if the callback is successfully removed, or false if the fence has
already been signaled.

*WARNING*:
Cancelling a callback should only be done if you really know what you're
doing, since deadlocks and race conditions could occur all too easily. For
this reason, it should only ever be done on hardware lockup recovery,
with a reference held to the fence.

Behaviour is undefined if \fIcb\fP has not been added to \fIfence\fP using
\fBdma_fence_add_callback\fP beforehand.
