.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "struct scsi_device *" scsi_get_host_dev
.BI "(struct Scsi_Host *shost "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "shost" 12
Host that needs a scsi_device
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Lock status: None assumed.
.SH "RETURN"
The scsi_device or NULL
.SH "NOTES"
Attach a single scsi_device to the Scsi_Host - this should
be made to look like a "pseudo-device" that points to the
HA itself.

Note - this device is not accessible from any high-level
drivers (including generics), which is probably not
optimal.  We can add hooks later to attach.
