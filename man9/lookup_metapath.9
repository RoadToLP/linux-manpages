.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Assumes that the inode's buffer has already been looked up and
hooked onto mp->mp_bh[0] and that the metapath has been initialised
by \fBfind_metapath\fP.

If this function encounters part of the tree which has not been
allocated, it returns the current height of the tree at the point
at which it found the unallocated block. Blocks which are found are
added to the mp->mp_bh[] list.
.SH "RETURN"
