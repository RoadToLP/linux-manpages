.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "ssize_t" assign_domain_store
.BI "(struct device *dev "  ","
.BI "struct device_attribute *attr "  ","
.BI "const char *buf "  ","
.BI "size_t count "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dev" 12
the matrix device
.IP "attr" 12
the mediated matrix device's assign_domain attribute
.IP "buf" 12
a buffer containing the AP queue index (APQI) of the domain to
be assigned
.IP "count" 12
the number of bytes in \fIbuf\fP
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Parses the APQI from \fIbuf\fP and sets the corresponding bit in the mediated
matrix device's AQM.

Returns the number of bytes processed if the APQI is valid; otherwise returns
one of the following errors:

1. -EINVAL
The APQI is not a valid number

2. -ENODEV
The APQI exceeds the maximum value configured for the system

3. -EADDRNOTAVAIL
An APQN derived from the cross product of the APQI being assigned
and the APIDs previously assigned is not bound to the vfio_ap device
driver; or, if no APIDs have yet been assigned, the APQI is not
contained in an APQN bound to the vfio_ap device driver.

4. -EADDRINUSE
An APQN derived from the cross product of the APQI being assigned
and the APIDs previously assigned is being used by another mediated
matrix device
