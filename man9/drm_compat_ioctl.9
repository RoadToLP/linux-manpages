.SH NAME
drm_compat_ioctl \- 32bit IOCTL compatibility handler for DRM drivers
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "long" drm_compat_ioctl
.BI "(struct file *filp "  ","
.BI "unsigned int cmd "  ","
.BI "unsigned long arg "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "filp" 12
file this ioctl is called on
.IP "cmd" 12
ioctl cmd number
.IP "arg" 12
user argument
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Compatibility handler for 32 bit userspace running on 64 kernels. All actual
IOCTL handling is forwarded to \fBdrm_ioctl\fP, while marshalling structures as
appropriate. Note that this only handles DRM core IOCTLs, if the driver has
botched IOCTL itself, it must handle those by wrapping this function.
.SH "RETURN"
Zero on success, negative error code on failure.
