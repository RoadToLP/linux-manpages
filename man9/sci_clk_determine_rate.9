.IP "hw" 12
clock to change rate for
.IP "req" 12
requested rate configuration for the clock
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Determines a suitable clock rate and parent for a TI SCI clock.
The parent handling is un-used, as generally the parent clock rates
are not known by the kernel; instead these are internally handled
by the firmware. Returns 0 on success, negative error value on failure.
