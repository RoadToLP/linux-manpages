.SH NAME
virtqueue_enable_cb \- restart callbacks after disable_cb.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "bool" virtqueue_enable_cb
.BI "(struct virtqueue *_vq "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "_vq" 12
the struct virtqueue we're talking about.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This re-enables callbacks; it returns "false" if there are pending
buffers in the queue, to detect a possible race between the driver
checking for more work, and enabling callbacks.

Caller must ensure we don't call this with other virtqueue
operations at the same time (except where noted).
