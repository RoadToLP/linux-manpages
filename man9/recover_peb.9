.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function is called in case of a write failure and moves all good data
from the potentially bad physical eraseblock to a good physical eraseblock.
This function also writes the data which was not written due to the failure.
Returns 0 in case of success, and a negative error code in case of failure.
This function tries UBI_IO_RETRIES before giving up.
