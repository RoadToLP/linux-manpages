.SH NAME
dwc2_hs_pmap_schedule \- Schedule in the main high speed schedule
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" dwc2_hs_pmap_schedule
.BI "(struct dwc2_hsotg *hsotg "  ","
.BI "struct dwc2_qh *qh "  ","
.BI "bool only_one_period "  ","
.BI "int index "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "hsotg" 12
The HCD state structure for the DWC OTG controller.
.IP "qh" 12
QH for the periodic transfer.
.IP "only_one_period" 12
If true we will limit ourselves to just looking at
one period (aka one 100us chunk).  This is used if we have
already scheduled something on the low speed schedule and
need to find something that matches on the high speed one.
.IP "index" 12
The index into qh->hs_transfers that we're working with.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

This will schedule something on the main dwc2 schedule.

We'll start looking in qh->hs_transfers[index].start_schedule_us.  We'll
update this with the result upon success.  We also use the duration from
the same structure.
.SH "RETURN"
0 for success or an error code.  Upon success the
dwc2_hs_transfer_time specified by "index" will be updated.
