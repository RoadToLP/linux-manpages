.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" dwc2_hc_continue_transfer
.BI "(struct dwc2_hsotg *hsotg "  ","
.BI "struct dwc2_host_chan *chan "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "hsotg" 12
Programming view of DWC_otg controller
.IP "chan" 12
Information needed to initialize the host channel
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The caller must ensure there is sufficient space in the request queue and Tx
Data FIFO. This function should only be called in Slave mode. In DMA mode,
the controller acts autonomously to complete transfers programmed to a host
channel.

For an OUT transfer, a new data packet is loaded into the appropriate FIFO
if there is any data remaining to be queued. For an IN transfer, another
data packet is always requested. For the SETUP phase of a control transfer,
this function does nothing.
.SH "RETURN"
1 if a new request is queued, 0 if no more requests are required
for this transfer
