.SH NAME
can_rx_offload_offload_one \- Read one CAN frame from HW
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "struct sk_buff *" can_rx_offload_offload_one
.BI "(struct can_rx_offload *offload "  ","
.BI "unsigned int n "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "offload" 12
pointer to rx_offload context
.IP "n" 12
number of mailbox to read
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The task of this function is to read a CAN frame from mailbox \fIn\fP
from the device and return the mailbox's content as a struct
sk_buff.

If the struct can_rx_offload::skb_queue exceeds the maximal queue
length (struct can_rx_offload::skb_queue_len_max) or no skb can be
allocated, the mailbox contents is discarded by reading it into an
overflow buffer. This way the mailbox is marked as free by the
driver.
.SH "RETURN"
A pointer to skb containing the CAN frame on success.

NULL if the mailbox \fIn\fP is empty.

\fBERR_PTR\fP in case of an error
