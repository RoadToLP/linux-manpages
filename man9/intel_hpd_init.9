.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function enables the hotplug support. It requires that interrupts have
already been enabled with \fBintel_irq_init_hw\fP. From this point on hotplug and
poll request can run concurrently to other code, so locking rules must be
obeyed.

This is a separate step from interrupt enabling to simplify the locking rules
in the driver load and resume code.

Also see: \fBintel_hpd_poll_enable\fP and \fBintel_hpd_poll_disable\fP.
