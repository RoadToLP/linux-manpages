.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" drm_noop
.BI "(struct drm_device *dev "  ","
.BI "void *data "  ","
.BI "struct drm_file *file_priv "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dev" 12
DRM device for the ioctl
.IP "data" 12
data pointer for the ioctl
.IP "file_priv" 12
DRM file for the ioctl call
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This no-op implementation for drm ioctls is useful for deprecated
functionality where we can't return a failure code because existing userspace
checks the result of the ioctl, but doesn't care about the action.

Always returns successfully with 0.
