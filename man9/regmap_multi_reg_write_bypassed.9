Write multiple registers to the device but not the cache where the set
of register are supplied in any order.

This function is intended to be used for writing a large block of data
atomically to the device in single transfer for those I2C client devices
that implement this alternative block write mode.

A value of zero will be returned on success, a negative errno will
be returned in error cases.
