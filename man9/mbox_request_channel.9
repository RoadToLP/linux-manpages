.SH NAME
mbox_request_channel \- Request a mailbox channel.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "struct mbox_chan *" mbox_request_channel
.BI "(struct mbox_client *cl "  ","
.BI "int index "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "cl" 12
Identity of the client requesting the channel.
.IP "index" 12
Index of mailbox specifier in 'mboxes' property.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The Client specifies its requirements and capabilities while asking for
a mailbox channel. It can't be called from atomic context.
The channel is exclusively allocated and can't be used by another
client before the owner calls mbox_free_channel.
After assignment, any packet received on this channel will be
handed over to the client via the 'rx_callback'.
The framework holds reference to the client, so the mbox_client
structure shouldn't be modified until the mbox_free_channel returns.
.SH "RETURN"
Pointer to the channel assigned to the client if successful.
ERR_PTR for request failure.
