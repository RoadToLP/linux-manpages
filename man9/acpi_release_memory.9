.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Walks through \fIhandle\fP and unmaps all SystemMemory Operation Regions that
overlap with \fIres\fP and that have already been activated (mapped).

This is a helper that allows drivers to place special requirements on memory
region that may overlap with operation regions, primarily allowing them to
safely map the region as non-cached memory.

The unmapped Operation Regions will be automatically remapped next time they
are called, so the drivers do not need to do anything else.
