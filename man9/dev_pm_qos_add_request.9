.SH NAME
dev_pm_qos_add_request \- inserts new qos request into the list
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" dev_pm_qos_add_request
.BI "(struct device *dev "  ","
.BI "struct dev_pm_qos_request *req "  ","
.BI "enum dev_pm_qos_req_type type "  ","
.BI "s32 value "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dev" 12
target device for the constraint
.IP "req" 12
pointer to a preallocated handle
.IP "type" 12
type of the request
.IP "value" 12
defines the qos request
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function inserts a new entry in the device constraints list of
requested qos performance characteristics. It recomputes the aggregate
QoS expectations of parameters and initializes the dev_pm_qos_request
handle.  Caller needs to save this handle for later use in updates and
removal.

Returns 1 if the aggregated constraint value has changed,
0 if the aggregated constraint value has not changed,
-EINVAL in case of wrong parameters, -ENOMEM if there's not enough memory
to allocate for data structures, -ENODEV if the device has just been removed
from the system.

Callers should ensure that the target device is not RPM_SUSPENDED before
using this function for requests of type DEV_PM_QOS_FLAGS.
