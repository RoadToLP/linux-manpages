.SH NAME
omap_calculate_ecc_bch_sw \- ECC generator for sector for SW based correction
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" omap_calculate_ecc_bch_sw
.BI "(struct nand_chip *chip "  ","
.BI "const u_char *dat "  ","
.BI "u_char *ecc_calc "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "chip" 12
NAND chip object
.IP "dat" 12
The pointer to data on which ecc is computed
.IP "ecc_calc" 12
Buffer storing the calculated ECC bytes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Support calculating of BCH4/8/16 ECC vectors for one sector. This is used
when SW based correction is required as ECC is required for one sector
at a time.
