.SH NAME
lpfc_issue_els_farpr \- Issue a farp to an node on a vport
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" lpfc_issue_els_farpr
.BI "(struct lpfc_vport *vport "  ","
.BI "uint32_t nportid "  ","
.BI "uint8_t retry "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "vport" 12
pointer to a host virtual N_Port data structure.
.IP "nportid" 12
N_Port identifier to the remote node.
.IP "retry" 12
number of retries to the command IOCB.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This routine issues a Fibre Channel Address Resolution Response
(FARPR) to a node on a vport. The remote node N_Port identifier (\fInportid\fP)
is passed into the function. It first search the \fIvport\fP node list to find
the matching ndlp. If no such ndlp is found, a new ndlp shall be created
for this (FARPR) purpose. An IOCB is allocated, payload prepared, and the
\fBlpfc_sli_issue_iocb\fP routine is invoked to send the FARPR ELS command.

Note that, in \fBlpfc_prep_els_iocb\fP routine, the reference count of ndlp
will be incremented by 1 for holding the ndlp and the reference to ndlp
will be stored into the context1 field of the IOCB for the completion
callback function to the PARPR ELS command.

Return code
0 - Successfully issued farpr command
1 - Failed to issue farpr command
