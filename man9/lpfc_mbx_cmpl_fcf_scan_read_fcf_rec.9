.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function iterates through all the fcf records available in
HBA and chooses the optimal FCF record for discovery. After finding
the FCF for discovery it registers the FCF record and kicks start
discovery.
If FCF_IN_USE flag is set in currently used FCF, the routine tries to
use an FCF record which matches fabric name and mac address of the
currently used FCF record.
If the driver supports only one FCF, it will try to use the FCF record
used by BOOT_BIOS.
