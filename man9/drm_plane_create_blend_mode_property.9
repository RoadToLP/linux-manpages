.SH NAME
drm_plane_create_blend_mode_property \- create a new blend mode property
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" drm_plane_create_blend_mode_property
.BI "(struct drm_plane *plane "  ","
.BI "unsigned int supported_modes "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "plane" 12
drm plane
.IP "supported_modes" 12
bitmask of supported modes, must include
BIT(DRM_MODE_BLEND_PREMULTI). Current DRM assumption is
that alpha is premultiplied, and old userspace can break if
the property defaults to anything else.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This creates a new property describing the blend mode.

The property exposed to userspace is an enumeration property (see
\fBdrm_property_create_enum\fP) called "pixel blend mode" and has the
following enumeration values:

"None":
Blend formula that ignores the pixel alpha.

"Pre-multiplied":
Blend formula that assumes the pixel color values have been already
pre-multiplied with the alpha channel values.

"Coverage":
Blend formula that assumes the pixel color values have not been
pre-multiplied and will do so when blending them to the background color
values.
.SH "RETURN"
Zero for success or -errno
