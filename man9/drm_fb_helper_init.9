.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" drm_fb_helper_init
.BI "(struct drm_device *dev "  ","
.BI "struct drm_fb_helper *fb_helper "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dev" 12
drm device
.IP "fb_helper" 12
driver-allocated fbdev helper structure to initialize
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This allocates the structures for the fbdev helper with the given limits.
Note that this won't yet touch the hardware (through the driver interfaces)
nor register the fbdev. This is only done in \fBdrm_fb_helper_initial_config\fP
to allow driver writes more control over the exact init sequence.

Drivers must call \fBdrm_fb_helper_prepare\fP before calling this function.
.SH "RETURN"
Zero if everything went ok, nonzero otherwise.
