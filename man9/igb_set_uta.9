The unicast table address is a register array of 32-bit registers.
The table is meant to be used in a way similar to how the MTA is used
however due to certain limitations in the hardware it is necessary to
set all the hash bits to 1 and use the VMOLR ROPE bit as a promiscuous
enable bit to allow vlan tag stripping when promiscuous mode is enabled
