.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "vsi" 12
ptr to the VSI
.IP "vsi_name" 12
name to display in messages
.IP "list" 12
the list of filters to send to firmware
.IP "num_del" 12
the number of filters to delete
.IP "retval" 12
Set to -EIO on failure to delete
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Send a request to firmware via AdminQ to delete a set of filters. Uses
*retval instead of a return value so that success does not force ret_val to
be set to 0. This ensures that a sequence of calls to this function
preserve the previous value of *retval on successful delete.
