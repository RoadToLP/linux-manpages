.SH NAME
snd_pcm_rate_mask_intersect \- computes the intersection between two rate masks
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "unsigned int" snd_pcm_rate_mask_intersect
.BI "(unsigned int rates_a "  ","
.BI "unsigned int rates_b "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "rates_a" 12
The first rate mask
.IP "rates_b" 12
The second rate mask
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function computes the rates that are supported by both rate masks passed
to the function. It will take care of the special handling of
SNDRV_PCM_RATE_CONTINUOUS and SNDRV_PCM_RATE_KNOT.
.SH "RETURN"
A rate mask containing the rates that are supported by both rates_a
and rates_b.
