.SH NAME
round_jiffies \- function to round jiffies to a full second
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "unsigned long" round_jiffies
.BI "(unsigned long j "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "j" 12
the time in (absolute) jiffies that should be rounded
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBround_jiffies\fP rounds an absolute time in the future (in jiffies)
up or down to (approximately) full seconds. This is useful for timers
for which the exact time they fire does not matter too much, as long as
they fire approximately every X seconds.

By rounding these timers to whole seconds, all such timers will fire
at the same time, rather than at various times spread out. The goal
of this is to have the CPU wake up less, which saves power.

The return value is the rounded version of the \fIj\fP parameter.
