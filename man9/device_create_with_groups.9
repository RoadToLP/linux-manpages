pointer to the parent struct device of this new device, if any
.IP "devt" 12
the dev_t for the char device to be added
.IP "drvdata" 12
the data to be added to the device for callbacks

variable arguments
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function can be used by char device classes.  A struct device
will be created in sysfs, registered to the specified class.
Additional attributes specified in the groups parameter will also
be created automatically.

A "dev" file will be created, showing the dev_t for the device, if
the dev_t is not 0,0.
If a pointer to a parent struct device is passed in, the newly created
struct device will be a child of that device in sysfs.
The pointer to the struct device will be returned from the call.
Any further sysfs files that might be required can be created using this
pointer.

Returns \fIstruct device\fP pointer on success, or \fBERR_PTR\fP on error.
.SH "NOTE"
the struct class passed to this function must have previously
been created with a call to \fBclass_create\fP.
