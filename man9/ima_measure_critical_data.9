.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "event_label" 12
unique event label for grouping and limiting critical data
.IP "event_name" 12
event name for the record in the IMA measurement list
.IP "buf" 12

and extend the pcr.  Examples of critical data could be various data
structures, policies, and states stored in kernel memory that can
impact the integrity of the system.
