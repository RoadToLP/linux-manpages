.SH NAME
device_register \- register a device with the system.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" device_register
.BI "(struct device *dev "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dev" 12
pointer to the device structure
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This happens in two clean steps - initialize the device
and add it to the system. The two steps can be called
separately, but this is the easiest and most common.
I.e. you should only call the two helpers separately if
have a clearly defined need to use and refcount the device
before it is added to the hierarchy.

For more information, see the kerneldoc for \fBdevice_initialize\fP
and \fBdevice_add\fP.
.SH "NOTE"
_Never_ directly free \fIdev\fP after calling this function, even
if it returned an error! Always use \fBput_device\fP to give up the
reference initialized in this function instead.
