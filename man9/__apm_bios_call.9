pointer to struct apm_bios_call.

Make an APM call using the 32bit protected mode interface. The
caller is responsible for knowing if APM BIOS is configured and
enabled. This call can disable interrupts for a long period of
time on some laptops.  The return value is in AH and the carry
flag is loaded into AL.  If there is an error, then the error
code is returned in AH (bits 8-15 of eax) and this function
returns non-zero.
.SH "NOTE"
this makes the call on the current CPU.
