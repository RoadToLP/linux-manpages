.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Precalculate and preallocate a script for the insertion or replacement of an
object in an associative array.  This results in an edit script that can
either be applied or cancelled.

The function returns a pointer to an edit script or -ENOMEM.

The caller should lock against other modifications and must continue to hold
the lock until \fBassoc_array_apply_edit\fP has been called.

Accesses to the tree may take place concurrently with this function,
provided they hold the RCU read lock.
