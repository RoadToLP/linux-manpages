.SH "DESCRIPTION"

When the remote has finished tx, and all in-flight rx has been received and
pushed to the flip buffer, the remote may close its device. This will
drop DTR on the remote which will drop carrier here. Typically, the tty is
hung up when carrier is dropped or lost.

However, there is a race between the hang up and the line discipline
delivering its data to the reader. A hangup will cause the ldisc to flush
(ie., clear) the read buffer and flip buffer. Because of firewire's
relatively high throughput, the ldisc frequently lags well behind the driver,
resulting in lost data (which has already been received and written to
the flip buffer) when the remote closes its end.

Unfortunately, since the flip buffer offers no direct method for determining
if it holds data, ensuring the ldisc has delivered all data is problematic.
