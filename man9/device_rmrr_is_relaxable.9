.SH NAME
device_rmrr_is_relaxable \- Test whether the RMRR of this device is relaxable (ie. is allowed to be not enforced under some conditions)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "bool" device_rmrr_is_relaxable
.BI "(struct device *dev "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dev" 12
device handle
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
We assume that PCI USB devices with RMRRs have them largely
for historical reasons and that the RMRR space is not actively used post
boot.  This exclusion may change if vendors begin to abuse it.

The same exception is made for graphics devices, with the requirement that
any use of the RMRR regions will be torn down before assigning the device
to a guest.
.SH "RETURN"
true if the RMRR is relaxable, false otherwise
