.SH NAME
zpool_shrink \- Shrink the pool size
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" zpool_shrink
.BI "(struct zpool *zpool "  ","
.BI "unsigned int pages "  ","
.BI "unsigned int *reclaimed "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "zpool" 12
The zpool to shrink.
.IP "pages" 12
The number of pages to shrink the pool.
.IP "reclaimed" 12
The number of pages successfully evicted.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This attempts to shrink the actual memory size of the pool
by evicting currently used handle(s).  If the pool was
created with no zpool_ops, or the evict call fails for any
of the handles, this will fail.  If non-NULL, the \fIreclaimed\fP
parameter will be set to the number of pages reclaimed,
which may be more than the number of pages requested.

Implementations must guarantee this to be thread-safe.
.SH "RETURN"
0 on success, negative value on error/failure.
