.SH NAME
__i40e_chk_linearize \- Check if there are more than 8 buffers per packet
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "bool" __i40e_chk_linearize
.BI "(struct sk_buff *skb "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "skb" 12
send buffer
.SH "NOTE"
Our HW can't DMA more than 8 buffers to build a packet on the wire
and so we need to figure out the cases where we need to linearize the skb.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
For TSO we need to count the TSO header and segment payload separately.
As such we need to check cases where we have 7 fragments or more as we
can potentially require 9 DMA transactions, 1 for the TSO header, 1 for
the segment payload in the first descriptor, and another 7 for the
fragments.
