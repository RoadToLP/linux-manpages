.SH NAME
pci_acpi_optimize_delay \- optimize PCI D3 and D3cold delay from ACPI
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" pci_acpi_optimize_delay
.BI "(struct pci_dev *pdev "  ","
.BI "acpi_handle handle "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "pdev" 12
the PCI device whose delay is to be updated
.IP "handle" 12
ACPI handle of this device
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Update the d3hot_delay and d3cold_delay of a PCI device from the ACPI _DSM
control method of either the device itself or the PCI host bridge.

Function 8, "Reset Delay," applies to the entire hierarchy below a PCI
host bridge.  If it returns one, the OS may assume that all devices in
the hierarchy have already completed power-on reset delays.

Function 9, "Device Readiness Durations," applies only to the object
where it is located.  It returns delay durations required after various
events if the device requires less time than the spec requires.  Delays
from this function take precedence over the Reset Delay function.

These _DSM functions are defined by the draft ECN of January 28, 2014,
titled "ACPI additions for FW latency optimizations."
