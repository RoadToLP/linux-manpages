space available in tty driver write buffer

This is a helper function that handles one output character
(including special characters like TAB, CR, LF, etc.),
doing OPOST processing and putting the results in the
tty driver's write buffer.

Note that Linux currently ignores TABDLY, CRDLY, VTDLY, FFDLY
and NLDLY.  They simply aren't relevant in the world today.
If you ever need them, add them here.

Returns the number of bytes of buffer space used or -1 if
no space left.

Locking: should be called under the output_lock to protect
the column state and space left in the buffer
