.SH NAME
cgroup_kn_lock_live \- locking helper for cgroup kernfs methods
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "struct cgroup *" cgroup_kn_lock_live
.BI "(struct kernfs_node *kn "  ","
.BI "bool drain_offline "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "kn" 12
the kernfs_node being serviced
.IP "drain_offline" 12
perform offline draining on the cgroup
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This helper is to be used by a cgroup kernfs method currently servicing
\fIkn\fP.  It breaks the active protection, performs cgroup locking and
verifies that the associated cgroup is alive.  Returns the cgroup if
alive; otherwise, NULL.  A successful return should be undone by a
matching \fBcgroup_kn_unlock\fP invocation.  If \fIdrain_offline\fP is true, the
cgroup is drained of offlining csses before return.

Any cgroup kernfs method implementation which requires locking the
associated cgroup should use this helper.  It avoids nesting cgroup
locking under kernfs active protection and allows all kernfs operations
including self-removal.
