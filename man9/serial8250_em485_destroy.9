uart_8250_port port instance

The function is used to stop rs485 software emulating on the
\fIstruct uart_8250_port\fP* \fIp\fP. The function is idempotent, so it is safe to
call it multiple times.

The function is supposed to be called from .rs485_config callback
or from any other callback protected with p->port.lock spinlock.
