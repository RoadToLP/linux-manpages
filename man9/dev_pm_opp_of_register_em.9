.BI "(struct device *dev "  ","
.BI "struct cpumask *cpus "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dev" 12
Device for which an Energy Model has to be registered
.IP "cpus" 12
CPUs for which an Energy Model has to be registered. For
other type of devices it should be set to NULL.

This checks whether the "dynamic-power-coefficient" devicetree property has
been specified, and tries to register an Energy Model with it if it has.
Having this property means the voltages are known for OPPs and the EM
