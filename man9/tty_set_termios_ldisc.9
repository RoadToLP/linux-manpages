line discipline number

This is probably overkill for real world processors but
they are not on hot paths so a little discipline won't do
any harm.

The line discipline-related tty_struct fields are reset to
prevent the ldisc driver from re-using stale information for
the new ldisc instance.

Locking: takes termios_rwsem
