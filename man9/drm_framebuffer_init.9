.SH NAME
drm_framebuffer_init \- initialize a framebuffer
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" drm_framebuffer_init
.BI "(struct drm_device *dev "  ","
.BI "struct drm_framebuffer *fb "  ","
.BI "const struct drm_framebuffer_funcs *funcs "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dev" 12
DRM device
.IP "fb" 12
framebuffer to be initialized
.IP "funcs" 12
\&... with these functions
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Allocates an ID for the framebuffer's parent mode object, sets its mode
functions & device file and adds it to the master fd list.

IMPORTANT:
This functions publishes the fb and makes it available for concurrent access
by other users. Which means by this point the fb _must_ be fully set up -
since all the fb attributes are invariant over its lifetime, no further
locking but only correct reference counting is required.
.SH "RETURN"
Zero on success, error code on failure.
