.SH "DESCRIPTION"

For Ventura, driver/FW will operate in 63bit DMA addresses.

For invader-
By default, driver/FW will operate in 32bit DMA addresses
for consistent DMA mapping but if 32 bit consistent
DMA mask fails, driver will try with 63 bit consistent
mask provided FW is true 63bit DMA capable

For older controllers(Thunderbolt and MFI based adapters)-
driver/FW will operate in 32 bit consistent DMA addresses.
