.BI "(struct e1000_hw *hw "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "hw" 12
pointer to the HW structure

To prevent malicious write/erase of the NVM, set it to be read-only
so that the hardware ignores all write/erase cycles of the NVM via
the flash control registers.  The shadow-ram copy of the NVM will
still be updated, however any updates to this copy will not stick
across driver reloads.
