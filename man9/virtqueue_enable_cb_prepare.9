.SH NAME
virtqueue_enable_cb_prepare \- restart callbacks after disable_cb
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "unsigned" virtqueue_enable_cb_prepare
.BI "(struct virtqueue *_vq "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "_vq" 12
the struct virtqueue we're talking about.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This re-enables callbacks; it returns current queue state
in an opaque unsigned value. This value should be later tested by
virtqueue_poll, to detect a possible race between the driver checking for
more work, and enabling callbacks.

Caller must ensure we don't call this with other virtqueue
operations at the same time (except where noted).
