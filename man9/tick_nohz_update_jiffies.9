.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Called from interrupt entry when the CPU was idle

In case the sched_tick was stopped on this CPU, we have to check if jiffies
must be updated. Otherwise an interrupt handler could use a stale jiffy
value. We do this unconditionally on any CPU, as we don't know whether the
CPU, which has the update task assigned is in a long sleep.
