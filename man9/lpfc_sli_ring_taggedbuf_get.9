lpfc_sli_ring_taggedbuf_get \- find HBQ buffer associated with given tag
.SH SYNOPSIS

.BI "uint32_t tag "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "phba" 12
Pointer to HBA context object.
.IP "pring" 12
Pointer to driver SLI ring object.
.IP "tag" 12
Buffer tag.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Buffers posted using CMD_QUE_XRI64_CX iocb are in pring->postbufq
list. After HBA DMA data to these buffers, CMD_IOCB_RET_XRI64_CX
iocb is posted to the response ring with the tag of the buffer.
This function searches the pring->postbufq list using the tag
to find buffer associated with CMD_IOCB_RET_XRI64_CX
iocb. If the buffer is found then lpfc_dmabuf object of the
buffer is returned to the caller else NULL is returned.
This function is called with no lock held.
