q_vector to set WB_ON_ITR on
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
We need to tell hardware to write-back completed descriptors even when
interrupts are disabled. Descriptors will be written back on cache line
boundaries without WB_ON_ITR enabled, but if we don't enable WB_ON_ITR
descriptors may not be written back if they don't fill a cache line until
the next interrupt.

This sets the write-back frequency to whatever was set previously for the
ITR indices. Also, set the INTENA_MSK bit to make sure hardware knows we
aren't meddling with the INTENA_M bit.
