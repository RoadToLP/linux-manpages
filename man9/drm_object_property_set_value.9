.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "obj" 12
drm mode object to set property value for
.IP "property" 12
property to set
.IP "val" 12
value the property should be set to
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function sets a given property on a given object. This function only
changes the software state of the property, it does not call into the
driver's ->set_property callback.

Note that atomic drivers should not have any need to call this, the core will
ensure consistency of values reported back to userspace through the
appropriate ->atomic_get_property callback. Only legacy drivers should call
this function to update the tracked value (after clamping and other
restrictions have been applied).
.SH "RETURN"
Zero on success, error code on failure.
