.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Throttling Logic: This uses three parameters to calculate the new
throttle state of the cooling devices associated with the given zone.

Parameters used for Throttling:
P1. max_state: Maximum throttle state exposed by the cooling device.
P2. percentage[i]/100:
How 'effective' the 'i'th device is, in cooling the given zone.
P3. cur_trip_level/max_no_of_trips:
This describes the extent to which the devices should be throttled.
We do not want to throttle too much when we trip a lower temperature,
whereas the throttling is at full swing if we trip critical levels.
(Heavily assumes the trip points are in ascending order)
new_state of cooling device = P3 * P2 * P1
