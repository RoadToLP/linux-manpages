.BI "(struct generic_pm_domain *genpd "  ","
.BI "bool use_lock "  ","
.BI "unsigned int depth "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "genpd" 12
PM domain to power off, if possible.
.IP "use_lock" 12
use the lock.
.IP "depth" 12

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Check if the given PM domain can be powered off (during system suspend or
hibernation) and do that if so.  Also, in that case propagate to its parents.

This function is only called in "noirq" and "syscore" stages of system power
transitions. The "noirq" callbacks may be executed asynchronously, thus in
these cases the lock must be held.
