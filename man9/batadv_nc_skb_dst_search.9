.SH NAME
batadv_nc_skb_dst_search \- Loops through list of neighboring nodes to dst.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "bool" batadv_nc_skb_dst_search
.BI "(struct sk_buff *skb "  ","
.BI "struct batadv_neigh_node *neigh_node "  ","
.BI "struct ethhdr *ethhdr "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "skb" 12
data skb to forward
.IP "neigh_node" 12
next hop to forward packet to
.IP "ethhdr" 12
pointer to the ethernet header inside the skb
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Loops through the list of neighboring nodes the next hop has a good
connection to (receives OGMs with a sufficient quality). We need to find a
neighbor of our next hop that potentially sent a packet which our next hop
also received (overheard) and has stored for later decoding.
.SH "RETURN"
true if the skb was consumed (encoded packet sent) or false otherwise
