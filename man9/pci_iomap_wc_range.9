.SH NAME
pci_iomap_wc_range \- create a virtual WC mapping cookie for a PCI BAR
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void __iomem *" pci_iomap_wc_range
.BI "(struct pci_dev *dev "  ","
.BI "int bar "  ","
.BI "unsigned long offset "  ","
.BI "unsigned long maxlen "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dev" 12
PCI device that owns the BAR
.IP "bar" 12
BAR number
.IP "offset" 12
map memory at the given offset in BAR
.IP "maxlen" 12
max length of the memory to map
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Using this function you will get a __iomem address to your device BAR.
You can access it using ioread*() and iowrite*(). These functions hide
the details if this is a MMIO or PIO address space and will just do what
you expect from them in the correct way. When possible write combining
is used.

\fImaxlen\fP specifies the maximum length to map. If you want to get access to
the complete BAR from offset to the end, pass 0 here.
