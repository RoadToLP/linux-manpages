.SH NAME
parport_claim \- claim access to a parallel port device
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" parport_claim
.BI "(struct pardevice *dev "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dev" 12
pointer to structure representing a device on the port

This function will not block and so can be used from interrupt
context.  If \fBparport_claim\fP succeeds in claiming access to
the port it returns zero and the port is available to use.  It
may fail (returning non-zero) if the port is in use by another
driver and that driver is not willing to relinquish control of
the port.
