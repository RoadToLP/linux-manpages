.SH NAME
devm_memremap_pages \- remap and provide memmap backing for the given resource
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void *" devm_memremap_pages
.BI "(struct device *dev "  ","
.BI "struct dev_pagemap *pgmap "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dev" 12
hosting device for \fIres\fP
.IP "pgmap" 12
pointer to a struct dev_pagemap
.SH "NOTES"
1/ At a minimum the res and type members of \fIpgmap\fP must be initialized
by the caller before passing it to this function
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
2/ The altmap field may optionally be initialized, in which case
PGMAP_ALTMAP_VALID must be set in pgmap->flags.

3/ The ref field may optionally be provided, in which pgmap->ref must be
'live' on entry and will be killed and reaped at
\fBdevm_memremap_pages_release\fP time, or if this routine fails.

4/ range is expected to be a host memory range that could feasibly be
treated as a "System RAM" range, i.e. not a device mmio range, but
this is not enforced.
