.SH NAME
radeon_fence_wait_seq_timeout \- wait for a specific sequence numbers
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "long" radeon_fence_wait_seq_timeout
.BI "(struct radeon_device *rdev "  ","
.BI "u64 *target_seq "  ","
.BI "bool intr "  ","
.BI "long timeout "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "rdev" 12
radeon device pointer
.IP "target_seq" 12
sequence number(s) we want to wait for
.IP "intr" 12
use interruptable sleep
.IP "timeout" 12
maximum time to wait, or MAX_SCHEDULE_TIMEOUT for infinite wait
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Wait for the requested sequence number(s) to be written by any ring
(all asics).  Sequnce number array is indexed by ring id.
\fIintr\fP selects whether to use interruptable (true) or non-interruptable
(false) sleep when waiting for the sequence number.  Helper function
for radeon_fence_wait_*().
Returns remaining time if the sequence number has passed, 0 when
the wait timeout, or an error for all other cases.
-EDEADLK is returned when a GPU lockup has been detected.
