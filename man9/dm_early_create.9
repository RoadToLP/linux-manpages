.SH NAME
dm_early_create \- create a mapped device in early boot.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" dm_early_create
.BI "(struct dm_ioctl *dmi "  ","
.BI "struct dm_target_spec **spec_array "  ","
.BI "char **target_params_array "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dmi" 12
Contains main information of the device mapping to be created.
.IP "spec_array" 12
array of pointers to struct dm_target_spec. Describes the
mapping table of the device.
.IP "target_params_array" 12
array of strings with the parameters to a specific
target.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Instead of having the struct dm_target_spec and the parameters for every
target embedded at the end of struct dm_ioctl (as performed in a normal
ioctl), pass them as arguments, so the caller doesn't need to serialize them.
The size of the spec_array and target_params_array is given by
\fIdmi->target_count\fP.
This function is supposed to be called in early boot, so locking mechanisms
to protect against concurrent loads are not required.
