.SH NAME
ucb1x00_io_write \- set or clear IO outputs
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" ucb1x00_io_write
.BI "(struct ucb1x00 *ucb "  ","
.BI "unsigned int set "  ","
.BI "unsigned int clear "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "ucb" 12
UCB1x00 structure describing chip
.IP "set" 12
bitfield of IO pins to set to logic '1'
.IP "clear" 12
bitfield of IO pins to set to logic '0'

Set the IO output state of the specified IO pins.  The value
is retained if the pins are subsequently configured as inputs.
The \fIclear\fP bitfield has priority over the \fIset\fP bitfield -
outputs will be cleared.

ucb1x00_enable must have been called to enable the comms
before using this function.

This function takes a spinlock, disabling interrupts.
