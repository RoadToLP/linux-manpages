.SH NAME
snd_soc_add_pcm_runtime \- Add a pcm_runtime dynamically via dai_link
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" snd_soc_add_pcm_runtime
.BI "(struct snd_soc_card *card "  ","
.BI "struct snd_soc_dai_link *dai_link "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "card" 12
The ASoC card to which the pcm_runtime is added
.IP "dai_link" 12
The DAI link to find pcm_runtime
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function adds a pcm_runtime ASoC card by using dai_link.
.SH "NOTE"
Topology can use this API to add pcm_runtime when probing the
topology component. And machine drivers can still define static
DAI links in dai_link array.
