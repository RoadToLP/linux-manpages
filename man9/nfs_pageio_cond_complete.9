.SH "DESCRIPTION"
It is important to ensure that processes don't try to take locks
on non-contiguous ranges of pages as that might deadlock. This
function should be called before attempting to wait on a locked
nfs_page. It will complete the I/O if the page index 'index'
is not contiguous with the existing list of pages in 'desc'.
