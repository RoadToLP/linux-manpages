.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This routine prepares and issues an Accept (ACC) response to Address
Discover (ADISC) ELS command. It simply prepares the payload of the IOCB
and invokes the \fBlpfc_sli_issue_iocb\fP routine to send out the command.

Note that, in \fBlpfc_prep_els_iocb\fP routine, the reference count of ndlp
will be incremented by 1 for holding the ndlp and the reference to ndlp
will be stored into the context1 field of the IOCB for the completion
callback function to the ADISC Accept response ELS IOCB command.

Return code
0 - Successfully issued acc adisc response
1 - Failed to issue adisc acc response
