the mount on which to take a write
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This tells the low-level filesystem that a write is about to be performed to
it, and makes sure that writes are allowed (mount is read-write, filesystem
is not frozen) before returning success.  When the write operation is
finished, \fBmnt_drop_write\fP must be called.  This is effectively a refcount.
