.BI "(struct file *file "  ","
.BI "char __user *buf "  ","
.BI "size_t nbytes "  ","
.BI "loff_t *ppos "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "file" 12
The file pointer to read from.
.IP "buf" 12
The buffer to copy the data to.
.IP "nbytes" 12
The number of bytes to read.
.IP "ppos" 12
The position in the file to start reading from.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This routine reads data from the \fIphba\fP SLI4 PCI function queue information,
and copies to user \fIbuf\fP.
This routine only returns 1 EQs worth of information. It remembers the last
EQ read and jumps to the next EQ. Thus subsequent calls to queInfo will
retrieve all EQs allocated for the phba.
.SH "RETURN"
This function returns the amount of data that was read (this could be less
than \fInbytes\fP if the end of the file was reached) or a negative error value.
