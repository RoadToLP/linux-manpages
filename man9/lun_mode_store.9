.BI "struct device_attribute *attr "  ","
.BI "const char *buf "  ","
.BI "size_t count "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dev" 12
Generic device associated with the host.
.IP "attr" 12
Device attribute representing the LUN mode.
.IP "buf" 12
Buffer of length PAGE_SIZE containing the LUN mode in ASCII.
.IP "count" 12
Length of data resizing in \fIbuf\fP.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The CXL Flash AFU supports a dummy LUN mode where the external
links and storage are not required. Space on the FPGA is used
to create 1 or 2 small LUNs which are presented to the system
as if they were a normal storage device. This feature is useful
during development and also provides manufacturing with a way
to test the AFU without an actual device.

0 = external LUN[s] (default)
1 = internal LUN (1 x 64K, 512B blocks, id 0)
2 = internal LUN (1 x 64K, 4K blocks, id 0)
3 = internal LUN (2 x 32K, 512B blocks, ids 0,1)
4 = internal LUN (2 x 32K, 4K blocks, ids 0,1)
.SH "RETURN"
The size of the ASCII string returned in \fIbuf\fP.
