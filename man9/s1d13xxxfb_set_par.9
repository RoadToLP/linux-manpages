.SH NAME
s1d13xxxfb_set_par \- Alters the hardware state.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" s1d13xxxfb_set_par
.BI "(struct fb_info *info "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "info" 12
frame buffer structure

Using the fb_var_screeninfo in fb_info we set the depth of the
framebuffer. This function alters the par AND the
fb_fix_screeninfo stored in fb_info. It doesn't not alter var in
fb_info since we are using that data. This means we depend on the
data in var inside fb_info to be supported by the hardware.
xxxfb_check_var is always called before xxxfb_set_par to ensure this.

XXX TODO: write proper \fBs1d13xxxfb_check_var\fP, without which that
function is quite useless.
