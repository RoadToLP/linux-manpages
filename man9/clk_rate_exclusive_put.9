.SH NAME
clk_rate_exclusive_put \- release exclusivity over clock rate control
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" clk_rate_exclusive_put
.BI "(struct clk *clk "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "clk" 12
the clk over which the exclusivity is released
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBclk_rate_exclusive_put\fP completes a critical section during which a clock
consumer cannot tolerate any other consumer making any operation on the
clock which could result in a rate change or rate glitch. Exclusive clocks
cannot have their rate changed, either directly or indirectly due to changes
further up the parent chain of clocks. As a result, clocks up parent chain
also get under exclusive control of the calling consumer.

If exlusivity is claimed more than once on clock, even by the same consumer,
the rate effectively gets locked as exclusivity can't be preempted.

Calls to \fBclk_rate_exclusive_put\fP must be balanced with calls to
\fBclk_rate_exclusive_get\fP. Calls to this function may sleep, and do not return
error status.
