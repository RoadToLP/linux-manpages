.SH "DESCRIPTION"

register the smackfs

Do not register smackfs if Smack wasn't enabled
on boot. We can not put this method normally under the
\fBsmack_init\fP code path since the security subsystem get
initialized before the vfs caches.

Returns true if we were not chosen on boot or if
we were chosen and filesystem registration succeeded.
