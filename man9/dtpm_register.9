.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" dtpm_register
.BI "(const char *name "  ","
.BI "struct dtpm *dtpm "  ","
.BI "struct dtpm *parent "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "name" 12
a string specifying the name of the node
.IP "dtpm" 12
a pointer to a dtpm structure corresponding to the new node
.IP "parent" 12
a pointer to a dtpm structure corresponding to the parent node
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Create a dtpm node in the tree. If no parent is specified, the node
is the root node of the hierarchy. If the root node already exists,
then the registration will fail. The powercap controller must be
initialized before calling this function.

The dtpm structure must be initialized with the power numbers
before calling this function.
.SH "RETURN"
zero on success, a negative value in case of error:
-EAGAIN: the function is called before the framework is initialized.
-EBUSY: the root node is already inserted
-EINVAL: * there is no root node yet and \fIparent\fP is specified
* no all ops are defined
* parent have ops which are reserved for leaves
Other negative values are reported back from the powercap framework
