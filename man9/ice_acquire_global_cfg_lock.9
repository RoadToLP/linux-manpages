.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function will request ownership of the global config lock for reading
or writing of the package. When attempting to obtain write access, the
caller must check for the following two return values:

ICE_SUCCESS        - Means the caller has acquired the global config lock
and can perform writing of the package.
ICE_ERR_AQ_NO_WORK - Indicates another driver has already written the
package or has found that no update was necessary; in
this case, the caller can just skip performing any
update of the package.
