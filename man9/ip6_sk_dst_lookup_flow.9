.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "sk" 12
socket which provides the dst cache and route info
.IP "fl6" 12
flow to lookup
.IP "final_dst" 12
final destination address for ipsec lookup
.IP "connected" 12
whether \fIsk\fP is connected or not

This function performs a route lookup on the given flow with the
possibility of using the cached route in the socket if it is valid.
It will take the socket dst lock when operating on the dst cache.
As a result, this function can only be used in process context.

In addition, for a connected socket, cache the dst in the socket
if the current cache is not valid.

It returns a valid dst pointer on success, or a pointer encoded
error code.
