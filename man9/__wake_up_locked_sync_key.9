__wake_up_locked_sync_key \- wake up a thread blocked on a locked waitqueue.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" __wake_up_locked_sync_key
.BI "(struct wait_queue_head *wq_head "  ","
.BI "unsigned int mode "  ","
.BI "void *key "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "wq_head" 12
the waitqueue
.IP "mode" 12
which threads
.IP "key" 12
opaque value to be passed to wakeup targets
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The sync wakeup differs in that the waker knows that it will schedule
away soon, so while the target thread will be woken up, it will not
be migrated to another CPU - ie. the two threads are 'synchronized'
with each other. This can prevent needless bouncing between CPUs.

On UP it can prevent extra preemption.

If this function wakes up a task, it executes a full memory barrier before
accessing the task state.
