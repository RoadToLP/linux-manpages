.SH NAME
srp_reconnect_rport \- reconnect to an SRP target port
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" srp_reconnect_rport
.BI "(struct srp_rport *rport "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "rport" 12
SRP target port.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Blocks SCSI command queueing before invoking \fBreconnect\fP such that
\fBqueuecommand\fP won't be invoked concurrently with \fBreconnect\fP from outside
the SCSI EH. This is important since a \fBreconnect\fP implementation may
reallocate resources needed by \fBqueuecommand\fP.
.SH "NOTES"
- This function neither waits until outstanding requests have finished nor
tries to abort these. It is the responsibility of the \fBreconnect\fP
function to finish outstanding commands before reconnecting to the target
port.
- It is the responsibility of the caller to ensure that the resources
reallocated by the \fBreconnect\fP function won't be used while this function
is in progress. One possible strategy is to invoke this function from
the context of the SCSI EH thread only. Another possible strategy is to
lock the rport mutex inside each SCSI LLD callback that can be invoked by
the SCSI EH (the scsi_host_template.eh_*() functions and also the
scsi_host_template.\fBqueuecommand\fP function).
