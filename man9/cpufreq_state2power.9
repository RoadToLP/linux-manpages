.SH NAME
cpufreq_state2power \- convert a cpu cdev state to power consumed
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" cpufreq_state2power
.BI "(struct thermal_cooling_device *cdev "  ","
.BI "unsigned long state "  ","
.BI "u32 *power "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "cdev" 12
\fIthermal_cooling_device\fP pointer
.IP "state" 12
cooling device state to be converted
.IP "power" 12
pointer in which to store the resulting power
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Convert cooling device state \fIstate\fP into power consumption in
milliwatts assuming 100% load.  Store the calculated power in
\fIpower\fP.
.SH "RETURN"
0 on success, -EINVAL if the cooling device state could not
