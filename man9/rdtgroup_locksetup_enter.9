rdtgroup_locksetup_enter \- Resource group enters locksetup mode
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" rdtgroup_locksetup_enter
.BI "(struct rdtgroup *rdtgrp "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "rdtgrp" 12
resource group requested to enter locksetup mode
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
A resource group enters locksetup mode to reflect that it would be used
to represent a pseudo-locked region and is in the process of being set
up to do so. A resource group used for a pseudo-locked region would
lose the closid associated with it so we cannot allow it to have any
tasks or cpus assigned nor permit tasks or cpus to be assigned in the
future. Monitoring of a pseudo-locked region is not allowed either.

The above and more restrictions on a pseudo-locked region are checked
for and enforced before the resource group enters the locksetup mode.
.SH "RETURN"
0 if the resource group successfully entered locksetup mode, <0
on failure. On failure the last_cmd_status buffer is updated with text to
communicate details of failure to the user.
