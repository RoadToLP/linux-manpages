.SH NAME
spi_alloc_device \- Allocate a new SPI device
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "struct spi_device *" spi_alloc_device
.BI "(struct spi_controller *ctlr "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "ctlr" 12
Controller to which device is connected
.SH "CONTEXT"
can sleep
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Allows a driver to allocate and initialize a spi_device without
registering it immediately.  This allows a driver to directly
fill the spi_device with device parameters before calling
\fBspi_add_device\fP on it.

Caller is responsible to call \fBspi_add_device\fP on the returned
spi_device structure to add it to the SPI controller.  If the caller
needs to discard the spi_device without adding it, then it should
call \fBspi_dev_put\fP on it.
.SH "RETURN"
a pointer to the new device, or NULL.
