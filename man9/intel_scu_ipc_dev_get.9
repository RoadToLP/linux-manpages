The recommended new API takes SCU IPC instance as parameter and this
function can be called by driver to get the instance. This also makes
sure the driver providing the IPC functionality cannot be unloaded
while the caller has the instance.

Call \fBintel_scu_ipc_dev_put\fP to release the instance.

Returns NULL if SCU IPC is not currently available.
