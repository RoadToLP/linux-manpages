.SH NAME
usb_autosuspend_device \- delayed autosuspend of a USB device and its interfaces
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" usb_autosuspend_device
.BI "(struct usb_device *udev "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "udev" 12
the usb_device to autosuspend
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This routine should be called when a core subsystem is finished using
\fIudev\fP and wants to allow it to autosuspend.  Examples would be when
\fIudev\fP's device file in usbfs is closed or after a configuration change.

\fIudev\fP's usage counter is decremented; if it drops to 0 and all the
interfaces are inactive then a delayed autosuspend will be attempted.
The attempt may fail (see \fBautosuspend_check\fP).

The caller must hold \fIudev\fP's device lock.

This routine can run only in process context.
