.SH NAME
netlbl_unlhsh_free_iface \- Frees an interface entry from the hash table
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" netlbl_unlhsh_free_iface
.BI "(struct rcu_head *entry "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "entry" 12
the entry's RCU field
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function is designed to be used as a callback to the \fBcall_rcu\fP
function so that memory allocated to a hash table interface entry can be
released safely.  It is important to note that this function does not free
the IPv4 and IPv6 address lists contained as part of an interface entry.  It
is up to the rest of the code to make sure an interface entry is only freed
once it's address lists are empty.
