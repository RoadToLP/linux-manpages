.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Remote device objects are a limited resource.  As such, they must be
protected.  Thus calls to construct and destruct are mutually exclusive and
non-reentrant. The return value shall indicate if the device was
successfully destructed or if some failure occurred. enum sci_status This value
is returned if the device is successfully destructed.
SCI_FAILURE_INVALID_REMOTE_DEVICE This value is returned if the supplied
device isn't valid (e.g. it's already been destoryed, the handle isn't
valid, etc.).
