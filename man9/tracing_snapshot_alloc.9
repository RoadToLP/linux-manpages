.SH "DESCRIPTION"

This is similar to \fBtracing_snapshot\fP, but it will allocate the
snapshot buffer if it isn't already allocated. Use this only
where it is safe to sleep, as the allocation may sleep.

This causes a swap between the snapshot buffer and the current live
tracing buffer. You can use this to take snapshots of the live
trace when some condition is triggered, but continue to trace.
