.SH "DESCRIPTION"

This function looks at all the consumer fwnodes of \fIdev\fP and creates device
links between the consumer device and \fIdev\fP (supplier).

If the consumer device has not been added yet, then this function creates a
SYNC_STATE_ONLY link between \fIdev\fP (supplier) and the closest ancestor device
of the consumer fwnode. This is necessary to make sure \fIdev\fP doesn't get a
\fBsync_state\fP callback before the real consumer device gets to be added and
then probed.

Once device links are created from the real consumer to \fIdev\fP (supplier), the
fwnode links are deleted.
