.SH NAME
blk_cloned_rq_check_limits \- Helper function to check a cloned request for the new queue limits
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "blk_status_t" blk_cloned_rq_check_limits
.BI "(struct request_queue *q "  ","
.BI "struct request *rq "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "q" 12
the queue
.IP "rq" 12
the request being checked
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fIrq\fP may have been made based on weaker limitations of upper-level queues
in request stacking drivers, and it may violate the limitation of \fIq\fP.
Since the block layer and the underlying device driver trust \fIrq\fP
after it is inserted to \fIq\fP, it should be checked against \fIq\fP before
the insertion using this generic function.

Request stacking drivers like request-based dm may change the queue
limits when retrying requests on other queues. Those requests need
to be checked against the new queue limits again during dispatch.
