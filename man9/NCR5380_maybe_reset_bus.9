.SH "DESCRIPTION"
If the system crashed, it may have crashed with a connected target and
the SCSI bus busy. Check for BUS FREE phase. If not, try to abort the
currently established nexus, which we know nothing about. Failing that
do a bus reset.

Note that a bus reset will cause the chip to assert IRQ.

Returns 0 if successful, otherwise -ENXIO.
