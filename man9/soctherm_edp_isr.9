.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "irqreturn_t" soctherm_edp_isr
.BI "(int irq "  ","
.BI "void *arg "  ");"

The interrupt request number
.IP "arg" 12
Opaque pointer to an argument
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Writes to the OC_INTR_DISABLE register the over current interrupt status,
masking any asserted interrupts. Doing this prevents the same interrupts
from triggering this isr repeatedly. The thread woken by this isr will
handle asserted interrupts and subsequently unmask/re-enable them.

The OC_INTR_DISABLE register indicates which OC interrupts
have been disabled.
.SH "RETURN"
IRQ_WAKE_THREAD, handler requests to wake the handler thread
