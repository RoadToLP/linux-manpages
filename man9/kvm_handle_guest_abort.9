.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Any abort that gets to the host is almost guaranteed to be caused by a
missing second stage translation table entry, which can mean that either the
guest simply needs more memory and we must allocate an appropriate page or it
can mean that the guest tried to access I/O memory, which is emulated by user
space. The distinction is based on the IPA causing the fault and whether this
memory region has been registered as standard RAM by user space.
