.SH "DESCRIPTION"
If we're not in VLAN mode, just add the filter to I40E_VLAN_ANY. Otherwise,
go through all the macvlan filters and add a macvlan filter for each
unique vlan that already exists. If a PVID has been assigned, instead only
add the macaddr to that VLAN.

Returns last filter added on success, else NULL
