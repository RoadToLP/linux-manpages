.SH NAME
apm_get_event \- get an APM event from the BIOS
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" apm_get_event
.BI "(apm_event_t *event "  ","
.BI "apm_eventinfo_t *info "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "event" 12
pointer to the event
.IP "info" 12
point to the event information

The APM BIOS provides a polled information for event
reporting. The BIOS expects to be polled at least every second
when events are pending. When a message is found the caller should
poll until no more messages are present.  However, this causes
problems on some laptops where a suspend event notification is
not cleared until it is acknowledged.

Additional information is returned in the info pointer, providing
that APM 1.2 is in use. If no messges are pending the value 0x80
is returned (No power management events pending).
