.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function returns 1 if the node is in the TNC, 0 if it is not, and a
negative error code in case of failure. For index nodes, \fIkey\fP has to be the
key of the first child. An index node is considered to be in the TNC only if
the corresponding znode is clean or has not been loaded.
