.SH NAME
atmel_lcdfb_set_par \- Alters the hardware state.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" atmel_lcdfb_set_par
.BI "(struct fb_info *info "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "info" 12
frame buffer structure that represents a single frame buffer

Using the fb_var_screeninfo in fb_info we set the resolution
of the this particular framebuffer. This function alters the
par AND the fb_fix_screeninfo stored in fb_info. It doesn't
not alter var in fb_info since we are using that data. This
means we depend on the data in var inside fb_info to be
supported by the hardware.  atmel_lcdfb_check_var is always called
before atmel_lcdfb_set_par to ensure this.  Again if you can't
change the resolution you don't need this function.
