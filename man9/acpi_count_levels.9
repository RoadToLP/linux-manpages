processor node we wish to count caches for
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Given a processor node containing a processing unit, walk into it and count
how many levels exist solely for it, and then walk up each level until we hit
the root node (ignore the package level because it may be possible to have
caches that exist across packages). Count the number of cache levels that
exist at each level on the way up.
.SH "RETURN"
Total number of levels found.
