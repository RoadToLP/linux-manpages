.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Returns an async_cookie_t that may be used for checkpointing later.
\fIdomain\fP may be used in the async_synchronize_*\fB_domain\fP functions to
wait within a certain synchronization domain rather than globally.

The node requested will be honored on a best effort basis. If the node
has no CPUs associated with it then the work is distributed among all
available CPUs.
