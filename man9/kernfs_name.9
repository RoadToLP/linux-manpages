.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Copies the name of \fIkn\fP into \fIbuf\fP of \fIbuflen\fP bytes.  The behavior is
similar to \fBstrlcpy\fP.  It returns the length of \fIkn\fP's name and if \fIbuf\fP
isn't long enough, it's filled upto \fIbuflen\fP-1 and nul terminated.

Fills buffer with "(null)" if \fIkn\fP is NULL.

This function can be called from any context.
