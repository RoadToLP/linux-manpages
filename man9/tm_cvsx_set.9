.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function sets in transaction checkpointed VSX registers.

When the transaction is active 'ckfp_state' holds the checkpointed
VSX register values for the current transaction to fall back on
if it aborts in between. This function sets these checkpointed
FPR registers. The userspace interface buffer layout is as follows.

struct data {
u64     vsx[32];
};
