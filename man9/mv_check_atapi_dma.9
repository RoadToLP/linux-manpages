.SH NAME
mv_check_atapi_dma \- Filter ATAPI cmds which are unsuitable for DMA.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" mv_check_atapi_dma
.BI "(struct ata_queued_cmd *qc "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "qc" 12
queued command to check for chipset/DMA compatibility.

The bmdma engines cannot handle speculative data sizes
(bytecount under/over flow).  So only allow DMA for
data transfer commands with known data sizes.

LOCKING:
Inherited from caller.
