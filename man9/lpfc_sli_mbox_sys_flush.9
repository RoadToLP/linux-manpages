.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This routine flushes the mailbox command subsystem. It will unconditionally
flush all the mailbox commands in the three possible stages in the mailbox
command sub-system: pending mailbox command queue; the outstanding mailbox
command; and completed mailbox command queue. It is caller's responsibility
to make sure that the driver is in the proper state to flush the mailbox
command sub-system. Namely, the posting of mailbox commands into the
pending mailbox command queue from the various clients must be stopped;
either the HBA is in a state that it will never works on the outstanding
mailbox command (such as in EEH or ERATT conditions) or the outstanding
mailbox command has been completed.
