.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Reload the HW tables from the SW tables after they've been bashed
by a chip reset.

Any VF entries are removed from the SW and HW tables since either
(a) the VF also gets reset on PF reset and will ask again for the
offloads, or (b) the VF has been removed by a change in the num_vfs.
