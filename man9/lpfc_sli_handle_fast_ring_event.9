.SH NAME
lpfc_sli_handle_fast_ring_event \- Handle ring events on FCP ring
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" lpfc_sli_handle_fast_ring_event
.BI "(struct lpfc_hba *phba "  ","
.BI "struct lpfc_sli_ring *pring "  ","
.BI "uint32_t mask "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "phba" 12
Pointer to HBA context object.
.IP "pring" 12
Pointer to driver SLI ring object.
.IP "mask" 12
Host attention register mask for this ring.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function is called from the interrupt context when there is a ring
event for the fcp ring. The caller does not hold any lock.
The function processes each response iocb in the response ring until it
finds an iocb with LE bit set and chains all the iocbs up to the iocb with
LE bit set. The function will call the completion handler of the command iocb
if the response iocb indicates a completion for a command iocb or it is
an abort completion. The function will call lpfc_sli_process_unsol_iocb
function if this is an unsolicited iocb.
This routine presumes LPFC_FCP_RING handling and doesn't bother
to check it explicitly.
