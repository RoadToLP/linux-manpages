.SH NAME
check_corruption \- check the data area of PEB.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" check_corruption
.BI "(struct ubi_device *ubi "  ","
.BI "struct ubi_vid_hdr *vid_hdr "  ","
.BI "int pnum "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "ubi" 12
UBI device description object
.IP "vid_hdr" 12
the (corrupted) VID header of this PEB
.IP "pnum" 12
the physical eraseblock number to check
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This is a helper function which is used to distinguish between VID header
corruptions caused by power cuts and other reasons. If the PEB contains only
0xFF bytes in the data area, the VID header is most probably corrupted
because of a power cut (0 is returned in this case). Otherwise, it was
probably corrupted for some other reasons (1 is returned in this case). A
negative error code is returned if a read error occurred.

If the corruption reason was a power cut, UBI can safely erase this PEB.
Otherwise, it should preserve it to avoid possibly destroying important
information.
