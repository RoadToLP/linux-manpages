.SH NAME
stmmac_clk_csr_set \- dynamically set the MDC clock
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" stmmac_clk_csr_set
.BI "(struct stmmac_priv *priv "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "priv" 12
driver private structure
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
this is to dynamically set the MDC clock according to the csr
clock input.
.SH "NOTE"
If a specific clk_csr value is passed from the platform
this means that the CSR Clock Range selection cannot be
changed at run-time and it is fixed (as reported in the driver
documentation). Viceversa the driver will try to set the MDC
clock dynamically according to the actual clock input.
