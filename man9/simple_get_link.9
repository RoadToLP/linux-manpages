.BI "struct inode *inode "  ","
.BI "struct delayed_call *done "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Generic helper for filesystems to use for symlink inodes where a pointer to
the symlink target is stored in ->i_link.  NOTE: this isn't normally called,
since as an optimization the path lookup code uses any non-NULL ->i_link
directly, without calling ->\fBget_link\fP.  But ->\fBget_link\fP still must be set,
to mark the inode_operations as being for a symlink.
.SH "RETURN"
the symlink target
