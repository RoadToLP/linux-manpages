intel_hpd_irq_handler \- main hotplug irq handler
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" intel_hpd_irq_handler
.BI "(struct drm_i915_private *dev_priv "  ","
.BI "u32 pin_mask "  ","
.BI "u32 long_mask "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dev_priv" 12
drm_i915_private
.IP "pin_mask" 12
a mask of hpd pins that have triggered the irq
.IP "long_mask" 12
a mask of hpd pins that may be long hpd pulses
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This is the main hotplug irq handler for all platforms. The platform specific
irq handlers call the platform specific hotplug irq handlers, which read and
decode the appropriate registers into bitmasks about hpd pins that have
triggered (\fIpin_mask\fP), and which of those pins may be long pulses
(\fIlong_mask\fP). The \fIlong_mask\fP is ignored if the port corresponding to the pin
is not a digital port.

Here, we do hotplug irq storm detection and mitigation, and pass further
processing to appropriate bottom halves.
