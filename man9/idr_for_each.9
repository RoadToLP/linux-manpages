.SH NAME
idr_for_each \- Iterate through all stored pointers.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" idr_for_each
.BI "(const struct idr *idr "  ","
.BI "int (*fn)(int id, void *p, void *data) "  ","
.BI "void *data "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "idr" 12
IDR handle.
.IP "fn" 12
Function to be called for each pointer.
.IP "data" 12
Data passed to callback function.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The callback function will be called for each entry in \fIidr\fP, passing
the ID, the entry and \fIdata\fP.

If \fIfn\fP returns anything other than 0, the iteration stops and that
value is returned from this function.

\fBidr_for_each\fP can be called concurrently with \fBidr_alloc\fP and
\fBidr_remove\fP if protected by RCU.  Newly added entries may not be
seen and deleted entries may be seen, but adding and removing entries
will not cause other entries to be skipped, nor spurious ones to be seen.
