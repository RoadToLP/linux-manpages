.SH NAME
aes_expandkey \- Expands the AES key as described in FIPS-197
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" aes_expandkey
.BI "(struct crypto_aes_ctx *ctx "  ","
.BI "const u8 *in_key "  ","
.BI "unsigned int key_len "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "ctx" 12
The location where the computed key will be stored.
.IP "in_key" 12
The supplied key.
.IP "key_len" 12
The length of the supplied key.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Returns 0 on success. The function fails only if an invalid key size (or
pointer) is supplied.
The expanded key size is 240 bytes (max of 14 rounds with a unique 16 bytes
key schedule plus a 16 bytes key which is used before the first round).
The decryption key is prepared for the "Equivalent Inverse Cipher" as
described in FIPS-197. The first slot (16 bytes) of each key (enc or dec) is
for the initial combination, the second slot for the first round and so on.
