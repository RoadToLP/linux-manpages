.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Determine if current task is an output poll worker.  This can be used
to select distinct code paths for output polling versus other contexts.

One use case is to avoid a deadlock between the output poll worker and
the autosuspend worker wherein the latter waits for polling to finish
upon calling \fBdrm_kms_helper_poll_disable\fP, while the former waits for
runtime suspend to finish upon calling \fBpm_runtime_get_sync\fP in a
connector ->detect hook.
