.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Drivers should call this to signal the completion of a previously queued
writeback job. It should be called as soon as possible after the hardware
has finished writing, and may be called from interrupt context.
It is the driver's responsibility to ensure that for a given connector, the
hardware completes writeback jobs in the same order as they are queued.

Unless the driver is holding its own reference to the framebuffer, it must
not be accessed after calling this function.
