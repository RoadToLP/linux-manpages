.SH NAME
drbd_bm_write_copy_pages \- Write the whole bitmap to its on disk location.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" drbd_bm_write_copy_pages
.BI "(struct drbd_device *device "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "device" 12
DRBD device.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Will only write pages that have changed since last IO.
In contrast to \fBdrbd_bm_write\fP, this will copy the bitmap pages
to temporary writeout pages. It is intended to trigger a full write-out
while still allowing the bitmap to change, for example if a resync or online
verify is aborted due to a failed peer disk, while local IO continues, or
pending resync acks are still being processed.
