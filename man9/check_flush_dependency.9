.SH "DESCRIPTION"
current is trying to flush the whole \fItarget_wq\fP or \fItarget_work\fP on it.
If \fItarget_wq\fP doesn't have WQ_MEM_RECLAIM, verify that current is not
reclaiming memory or running on a workqueue which doesn't have
WQ_MEM_RECLAIM as that can break forward-progress guarantee leading to
a deadlock.
