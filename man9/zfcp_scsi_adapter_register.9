.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" zfcp_scsi_adapter_register
.BI "(struct zfcp_adapter *adapter "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "adapter" 12
The zfcp adapter to register with the SCSI midlayer
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Allocates the SCSI host object for the given adapter, sets basic properties
(such as the transport template, QDIO limits, ...), and registers it with
the midlayer.

During registration with the midlayer the corresponding FC host object for
the referenced transport class is also implicitely allocated.

Upon success adapter->scsi_host is set, and upon failure it remains NULL. If
adapter->scsi_host is already set, nothing is done.
.SH "RETURN"
* 0       - Allocation and registration was successful
* -EEXIST - SCSI and FC host did already exist, nothing was done, nothing
was changed
* -EIO    - Allocation or registration failed
