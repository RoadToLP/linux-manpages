.SH NAME
dev_pm_genpd_set_next_wakeup \- Notify PM framework of an impending wakeup.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" dev_pm_genpd_set_next_wakeup
.BI "(struct device *dev "  ","
.BI "ktime_t next "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dev" 12
Device to handle
.IP "next" 12
impending interrupt/wakeup for the device
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Allow devices to inform of the next wakeup. It's assumed that the users
guarantee that the genpd wouldn't be detached while this routine is getting
called. Additionally, it's also assumed that \fIdev\fP isn't runtime suspended
(RPM_SUSPENDED)."
Although devices are expected to update the next_wakeup after the end of
their usecase as well, it is possible the devices themselves may not know
about that, so stale \fInext\fP will be ignored when powering off the domain.
