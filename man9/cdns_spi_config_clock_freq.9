.SH NAME
cdns_spi_config_clock_freq \- Sets clock frequency
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" cdns_spi_config_clock_freq
.BI "(struct spi_device *spi "  ","
.BI "struct spi_transfer *transfer "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "spi" 12
Pointer to the spi_device structure
.IP "transfer" 12
Pointer to the spi_transfer structure which provides
information about next transfer setup parameters
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Sets the requested clock frequency.
.SH "NOTE"
If the requested frequency is not an exact match with what can be
obtained using the prescalar value the driver sets the clock frequency which
is lower than the requested frequency (maximum lower) for the transfer. If
the requested frequency is higher or lower than that is supported by the SPI
controller the driver will set the highest or lowest frequency supported by
controller.
