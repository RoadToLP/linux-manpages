.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Set the n-th bit of \fIdst\fP iff there exists some m such that the
n-th bit of \fIrelmap\fP is set, the m-th bit of \fIorig\fP is set, and
the n-th bit of \fIrelmap\fP is also the m-th _set_ bit of \fIrelmap\fP.
(If you understood the previous sentence the first time your
read it, you're overqualified for your current job.)

In other words, \fIorig\fP is mapped onto (surjectively) \fIdst\fP,
using the map { <n, m> | the n-th bit of \fIrelmap\fP is the
m-th set bit of \fIrelmap\fP }.

Any set bits in \fIorig\fP above bit number W, where W is the
weight of (number of set bits in) \fIrelmap\fP are mapped nowhere.
In particular, if for all bits m set in \fIorig\fP, m >= W, then
\fIdst\fP will end up empty.  In situations where the possibility
of such an empty result is not desired, one way to avoid it is
to use the \fBbitmap_fold\fP operator, below, to first fold the
\fIorig\fP bitmap over itself so that all its set bits x are in the
range 0 <= x < W.  The \fBbitmap_fold\fP operator does this by
setting the bit (m % W) in \fIdst\fP, for each bit (m) set in \fIorig\fP.

Example [1] for \fBbitmap_onto\fP:
Let's say \fIrelmap\fP has bits 30-39 set, and \fIorig\fP has bits
1, 3, 5, 7, 9 and 11 set.  Then on return from this routine,
\fIdst\fP will have bits 31, 33, 35, 37 and 39 set.

When bit 0 is set in \fIorig\fP, it means turn on the bit in
\fIdst\fP corresponding to whatever is the first bit (if any)
that is turned on in \fIrelmap\fP.  Since bit 0 was off in the
above example, we leave off that bit (bit 30) in \fIdst\fP.

When bit 1 is set in \fIorig\fP (as in the above example), it
means turn on the bit in \fIdst\fP corresponding to whatever
is the second bit that is turned on in \fIrelmap\fP.  The second
bit in \fIrelmap\fP that was turned on in the above example was
bit 31, so we turned on bit 31 in \fIdst\fP.

Similarly, we turned on bits 33, 35, 37 and 39 in \fIdst\fP,
because they were the 4th, 6th, 8th and 10th set bits
set in \fIrelmap\fP, and the 4th, 6th, 8th and 10th bits of
\fIorig\fP (i.e. bits 3, 5, 7 and 9) were also set.

When bit 11 is set in \fIorig\fP, it means turn on the bit in
\fIdst\fP corresponding to whatever is the twelfth bit that is
turned on in \fIrelmap\fP.  In the above example, there were
only ten bits turned on in \fIrelmap\fP (30..39), so that bit
11 was set in \fIorig\fP had no affect on \fIdst\fP.

Example [2] for \fBbitmap_fold\fP + \fBbitmap_onto\fP:
Let's say \fIrelmap\fP has these ten bits set::

40 41 42 43 45 48 53 61 74 95

(for the curious, that's 40 plus the first ten terms of the
Fibonacci sequence.)

Further lets say we use the following code, invoking
\fBbitmap_fold\fP then bitmap_onto, as suggested above to
avoid the possibility of an empty \fIdst\fP result::

unsigned long *tmp;     // a temporary bitmap's bits

bitmap_fold(tmp, orig, bitmap_weight(relmap, bits), bits);
bitmap_onto(dst, tmp, relmap, bits);

Then this table shows what various values of \fIdst\fP would be, for
various \fIorig\fP's.  I list the zero-based positions of each set bit.
The tmp column shows the intermediate result, as computed by
using \fBbitmap_fold\fP to fold the \fIorig\fP bitmap modulo ten
(the weight of \fIrelmap\fP):

\&.. [#f1]

For these marked lines, if we hadn't first done \fBbitmap_fold\fP
into tmp, then the \fIdst\fP result would have been empty.

If either of \fIorig\fP or \fIrelmap\fP is empty (no set bits), then \fIdst\fP
will be returned empty.

If (as explained above) the only set bits in \fIorig\fP are in positions
m where m >= W, (where W is the weight of \fIrelmap\fP) then \fIdst\fP will
once again be returned empty.

All bits in \fIdst\fP not set by the above rule are cleared.
