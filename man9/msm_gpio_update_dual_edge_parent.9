.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" msm_gpio_update_dual_edge_parent
.BI "(struct irq_data *d "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "d" 12
The irq dta.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This is much like \fBmsm_gpio_update_dual_edge_pos\fP but for IRQs that are
normally handled by the parent irqchip.  The logic here is slightly
different due to what's easy to do with our parent, but in principle it's
the same.
