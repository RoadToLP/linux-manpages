.SH NAME
binder_inc_node_tmpref \- take a temporary reference on node
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" binder_inc_node_tmpref
.BI "(struct binder_node *node "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "node" 12
node to reference
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Take reference on node to prevent the node from being freed
while referenced only by a local variable. The inner lock is
needed to serialize with the node work on the queue (which
isn't needed after the node is dead). If the node is dead
(node->proc is NULL), use binder_dead_nodes_lock to protect
node->tmp_refs against dead-node-only cases where the node
lock cannot be acquired (eg traversing the dead node list to
print nodes)
