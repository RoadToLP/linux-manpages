.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Look up the clocks and the address space used by the MPU to access
registers belonging to the hwmod \fIoh\fP.  \fIoh\fP must already be
registered at this point.  This is the first of two phases for
hwmod initialization.  Code called here does not touch any hardware
registers, it simply prepares internal data structures.  Returns 0
upon success or if the hwmod isn't registered or if the hwmod's
address space is not defined, or -EINVAL upon failure.
