.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Sends a request (or a part of the request) to the control endpoint (ep0 in).
If the request doesn't fit, the remaining part will be sent from irq.
The request is considered fully written only if either :
- last write transferred all remaining bytes, but fifo was not fully filled
- last write was a 0 length write

Returns 1 if request fully written, 0 if request only partially sent
