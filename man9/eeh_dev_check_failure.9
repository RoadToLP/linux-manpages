.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Check for an EEH failure for the given device node.  Call this
routine if the result of a read was all 0xff's and you want to
find out if this is due to an EEH slot freeze.  This routine
will query firmware for the EEH status.

Returns 0 if there has not been an EEH error; otherwise returns
a non-zero value and queues up a slot isolation event notification.

It is safe to call this routine in an interrupt context.
