.BI "(struct of_phandle_args *dma_spec "  ","
.BI "struct of_dma *ofdma "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dma_spec" 12
pointer to DMA specifier as found in the device tree
.IP "ofdma" 12
pointer to DMA controller data
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function can be used as the of xlate callback for DMA driver which wants
to match the channel based on the channel id. When using this xlate function
the #dma-cells propety of the DMA controller dt node needs to be set to 1.
