.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This routine is the completion callback function to the issuing of a LOGO
ELS command off a vport. It frees the command IOCB and then decrement the
reference count held on ndlp for this completion function, indicating that
the reference to the ndlp is no long needed. Note that the
\fBlpfc_els_free_iocb\fP routine decrements the ndlp reference held for this
callback function and an additional explicit ndlp reference decrementation
will trigger the actual release of the ndlp.
