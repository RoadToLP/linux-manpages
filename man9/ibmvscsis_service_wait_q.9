.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This routine is called when the timer pops to service the waiting
queue. Elements on the queue have completed, their responses have been
copied to the client, but the client's response queue was full so
the queue message could not be sent. The routine grabs the proper locks
and calls send messages.

EXECUTION ENVIRONMENT:
called at interrupt level
