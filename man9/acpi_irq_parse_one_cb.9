.SH NAME
acpi_irq_parse_one_cb \- Handle the given resource.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "acpi_status" acpi_irq_parse_one_cb
.BI "(struct acpi_resource *ares "  ","
.BI "void *context "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "ares" 12
resource to handle
.IP "context" 12
context for the walk
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This is called by acpi_walk_resources passing each resource returned by
the _CRS method. We only inspect IRQ resources. Since IRQ resources
might contain multiple interrupts we check if the index is within this
one's interrupt array, otherwise we subtract the current resource IRQ
count from the lookup index to prepare for the next resource.
Once a match is found we call acpi_irq_parse_one_match to populate
the result and end the walk by returning AE_CTRL_TERMINATE.
.SH "RETURN"
AE_OK if the walk should continue, AE_CTRL_TERMINATE if a matching
IRQ resource was found.
