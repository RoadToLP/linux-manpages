.SH NAME
mux_control_try_select \- Try to select the given multiplexer state.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" mux_control_try_select
.BI "(struct mux_control *mux "  ","
.BI "unsigned int state "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "mux" 12
The mux-control to request a change of state from.
.IP "state" 12
The new requested state.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
On successfully selecting the mux-control state, it will be locked until
\fBmux_control_deselect\fP called.

Therefore, make sure to call \fBmux_control_deselect\fP when the operation is
complete and the mux-control is free for others to use, but do not call
\fBmux_control_deselect\fP if \fBmux_control_try_select\fP fails.
.SH "RETURN"
0 when the mux-control state has the requested state or a negative
errno on error. Specifically -EBUSY if the mux-control is contended.
