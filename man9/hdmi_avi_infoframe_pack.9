.IP "frame" 12
HDMI AVI infoframe
.IP "buffer" 12
destination buffer
.IP "size" 12
size of buffer
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Validates that the infoframe is consistent and updates derived fields
(eg. length) based on other fields, after which it packs the information
contained in the \fIframe\fP structure into a binary representation that
can be written into the corresponding controller registers. This function
also computes the checksum as required by section 5.3.5 of the HDMI 1.4
specification.

Returns the number of bytes packed into the binary buffer or a negative
error code on failure.
