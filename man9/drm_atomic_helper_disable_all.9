.SH SYNOPSIS

.BI "(struct drm_device *dev "  ","

.SH ARGUMENTS

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Loops through all connectors, finding those that aren't turned off and then
turns them off by setting their DPMS mode to OFF and deactivating the CRTC
that they are connected to.

This is used for example in suspend/resume to disable all currently active
functions when suspending. If you just want to shut down everything at e.g.
driver unload, look at \fBdrm_atomic_helper_shutdown\fP.

Note that if callers haven't already acquired all modeset locks this might
return -EDEADLK, which must be handled by calling \fBdrm_modeset_backoff\fP.

See also:
\fBdrm_atomic_helper_suspend\fP, \fBdrm_atomic_helper_resume\fP and
\fBdrm_atomic_helper_shutdown\fP.
.SH "RETURN"
0 on success or a negative error code on failure.
