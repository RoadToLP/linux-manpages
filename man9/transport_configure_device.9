transport_configure_device \- configure an already set up device
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" transport_configure_device
.BI "(struct device *dev "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dev" 12
generic device representing device to be configured
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The idea of configure is simply to provide a point within the setup
process to allow the transport class to extract information from a
device after it has been setup.  This is used in SCSI because we
have to have a setup device to begin using the HBA, but after we
send the initial inquiry, we use configure to extract the device
parameters.  The device need not have been added to be configured.
