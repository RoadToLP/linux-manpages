.SH NAME
proc_douintvec_minmax \- read a vector of unsigned ints with min/max values
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" proc_douintvec_minmax
.BI "(struct ctl_table *table "  ","
.BI "int write "  ","
.BI "void *buffer "  ","
.BI "size_t *lenp "  ","
.BI "loff_t *ppos "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "table" 12
the sysctl table
.IP "write" 12
TRUE if this is a write to the sysctl file
.IP "buffer" 12
the user buffer
.IP "lenp" 12
the size of the user buffer
.IP "ppos" 12
file position
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Reads/writes up to table->maxlen/sizeof(unsigned int) unsigned integer
values from/to the user buffer, treated as an ASCII string. Negative
strings are not allowed.

This routine will ensure the values are within the range specified by
table->extra1 (min) and table->extra2 (max). There is a final sanity
check for UINT_MAX to avoid having to support wrap around uses from
userspace.

Returns 0 on success or -ERANGE on write when the range check fails.
