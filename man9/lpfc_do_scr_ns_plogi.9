.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This routine issues a Port Login (PLOGI) to the Name Server with
State Change Request (SCR) for a \fIvport\fP. This routine will create an
ndlp for the Name Server associated to the \fIvport\fP if such node does
not already exist. The PLOGI to Name Server is issued by invoking the
\fBlpfc_issue_els_plogi\fP routine. If Fabric-Device Management Interface
(FDMI) is configured to the \fIvport\fP, a FDMI node will be created and
the PLOGI to FDMI is issued by invoking \fBlpfc_issue_els_plogi\fP routine.
