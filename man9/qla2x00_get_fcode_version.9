qla2x00_get_fcode_version \- Determine an FCODE image's version.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" qla2x00_get_fcode_version
.BI "(struct qla_hw_data *ha "  ","
.BI "uint32_t pcids "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "ha" 12
HA context
.IP "pcids" 12
Pointer to the FCODE PCI data structure
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The process of retrieving the FCODE version information is at best
described as interesting.

Within the first 100h bytes of the image an ASCII string is present
which contains several pieces of information including the FCODE
version.  Unfortunately it seems the only reliable way to retrieve
the version is by scanning for another sentinel within the string,
the FCODE build date:

\&... 2.00.02 10/17/02 ...

Returns QLA_SUCCESS on successful retrieval of version.
