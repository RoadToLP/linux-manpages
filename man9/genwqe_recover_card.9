.SH NAME
genwqe_recover_card \- Try to recover the card if it is possible
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" genwqe_recover_card
.BI "(struct genwqe_dev *cd "  ","
.BI "int fatal_err "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "cd" 12
GenWQE device information
.IP "fatal_err" 12
Indicate whether to attempt soft reset
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
If fatal_err is set no register access is possible anymore. It is
likely that genwqe_start fails in that situation. Proper error
handling is required in this case.

\fBgenwqe_bus_reset\fP will cause the pci code to call \fBgenwqe_remove\fP
and later \fBgenwqe_probe\fP for all virtual functions.
