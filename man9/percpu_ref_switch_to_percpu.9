percpu_ref to switch to percpu mode
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
There's no reason to use this function for the usual reference counting.
To re-use an expired ref, use \fBpercpu_ref_reinit\fP.

Switch \fIref\fP to percpu mode.  This function may be invoked concurrently
with all the get/put operations and can safely be mixed with kill and
reinit operations.  This function reverses the sticky atomic state set
by PERCPU_REF_INIT_ATOMIC or \fBpercpu_ref_switch_to_atomic\fP.  If \fIref\fP is
dying or dead, the actual switching takes place on the following
\fBpercpu_ref_reinit\fP.

This function may block if \fIref\fP is in the process of switching to atomic
mode.  If the caller ensures that \fIref\fP is not in the process of
switching to atomic mode, this function can be called from any context.
