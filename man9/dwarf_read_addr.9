.BI "(unsigned long *src "  ","
.BI "unsigned long *dst "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "src" 12
source address of data
.IP "dst" 12
destination address to store the data to

Read 'n' bytes from \fIsrc\fP, where 'n' is the size of an address on
the native machine. We return the number of bytes read, which
should always be 'n'. We also have to be careful when reading
from \fIsrc\fP and writing to \fIdst\fP, because they can be arbitrarily
aligned. Return 'n' - the number of bytes read.
