drm_atomic_helper_wait_for_dependencies \- wait for required preceeding commits

atomic state object with old state structures
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function waits for all preceeding commits that touch the same CRTC as
\fIold_state\fP to both be committed to the hardware (as signalled by
\fBdrm_atomic_helper_commit_hw_done\fP) and executed by the hardware (as signalled
by calling \fBdrm_crtc_send_vblank_event\fP on the \fIdrm_crtc_state.event\fP).

This is part of the atomic helper support for nonblocking commits, see
\fBdrm_atomic_helper_setup_commit\fP for an overview.
