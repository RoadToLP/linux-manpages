.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Pause SCSI command processing on the specified device and wait until all
ongoing \fBscsi_request_fn\fP / \fBscsi_queue_rq\fP calls have finished. May sleep.

Returns zero if successful or a negative error code upon failure.
.SH "NOTE"
This routine transitions the device to the SDEV_BLOCK state (which must be
a legal transition). When the device is in this state, command processing
is paused until the device leaves the SDEV_BLOCK state. See also
\fBscsi_internal_device_unblock\fP.
