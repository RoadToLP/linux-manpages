.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" sxps2_write

.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "pserio" 12
pointer to the serio structure of the PS/2 port
.IP "c" 12
data that needs to be written to the PS/2 port
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function checks if the PS/2 transmitter is empty and sends a byte.
Otherwise it returns error. Transmission fails only when nothing is connected
to the PS/2 port. Thats why, we do not try to resend the data in case of a
failure.
