.SH NAME
nlmsvc_lookup_host \- Find an NLM host handle matching a remote client
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "struct nlm_host *" nlmsvc_lookup_host
.BI "(const struct svc_rqst *rqstp "  ","
.BI "const char *hostname "  ","
.BI "const size_t hostname_len "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "rqstp" 12
incoming NLM request
.IP "hostname" 12
name of client host
.IP "hostname_len" 12
length of client hostname
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Returns an nlm_host structure that matches the [client address,
transport protocol, NLM version, client hostname] of the passed-in
NLM request.  If one doesn't already exist in the host cache, a
new handle is created and returned.

Before possibly creating a new nlm_host, construct a sockaddr
for a specific source address in case the local system has
multiple network addresses.  The family of the address in
rq_daddr is guaranteed to be the same as the family of the
address in rq_addr, so it's safe to use the same family for
the source address.
