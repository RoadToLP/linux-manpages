.SH NAME
mem_dump_obj \- Print available provenance information
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" mem_dump_obj
.BI "(void *object "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "object" 12
object for which to find provenance information.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function uses \fBpr_cont\fP, so that the caller is expected to have
printed out whatever preamble is appropriate.  The provenance information
depends on the type of object and on how much debugging is enabled.
For example, for a slab-cache object, the slab name is printed, and,
if available, the return address and stack trace from the allocation
of that object.
