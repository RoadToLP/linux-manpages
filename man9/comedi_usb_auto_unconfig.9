.BI "(struct usb_interface *intf "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS

USB interface.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Typically called from the usb_driver (*disconnect) function.
Auto-unconfigure a COMEDI device attached to this USB interface, using a
pointer to the \fIstruct device\fP embedded in *\fIintf\fP as the hardware device.
The COMEDI driver's "detach" handler will be called during unconfiguration
of the COMEDI device.

Note that the COMEDI device may have already been unconfigured using the
COMEDI_DEVCONFIG ioctl, in which case this attempt to unconfigure it
again should be ignored.
