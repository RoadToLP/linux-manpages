.SH SYNOPSIS

.BI "(struct lpfc_hba *phba "  ","
.BI "struct lpfc_sli_ring *pring "  ","

.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "phba" 12
Pointer to HBA context object.
.IP "pring" 12
Pointer to driver SLI ring object.
.IP "rspiocbp" 12
Pointer to driver response IOCB object.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function is called from the worker thread when there is a slow-path
response IOCB to process. This function chains all the response iocbs until
seeing the iocb with the LE bit set. The function will call
lpfc_sli_process_sol_iocb function if the response iocb indicates a
completion of a command iocb. The function will call the
lpfc_sli_process_unsol_iocb function if this is an unsolicited iocb.
The function frees the resources or calls the completion handler if this
iocb is an abort completion. The function returns NULL when the response
iocb has the LE bit set and all the chained iocbs are processed, otherwise
this function shall chain the iocb on to the iocb_continueq and return the
response iocb passed in.
