.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function sets the maximum number of SCBs and
DDBs which can be used by the sequencer.  This is normally
512 and 128 respectively.  If support for more SCBs or more DDBs
is required then CMDCTXBASE, DEVCTXBASE and CTXDOMAIN are
initialized here to extend context memory to point to host memory,
thus allowing unlimited support for SCBs and DDBs -- only limited
by host memory.
