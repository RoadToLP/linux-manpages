.SH NAME
sprint_backtrace \- Look up a backtrace symbol and return it in a text buffer
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" sprint_backtrace
.BI "(char *buffer "  ","
.BI "unsigned long address "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "buffer" 12
buffer to be stored
.IP "address" 12
address to lookup
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function is for stack backtrace and does the same thing as
\fBsprint_symbol\fP but with modified/decreased \fIaddress\fP. If there is a
tail-call to the function marked "noreturn", gcc optimized out code after
the call so that the stack-saved return address could point outside of the
caller. This function ensures that kallsyms will find the original caller
by decreasing \fIaddress\fP.

This function returns the number of bytes stored in \fIbuffer\fP.
