.SH NAME
t4_eeprom_ptov \- translate a physical EEPROM address to virtual
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" t4_eeprom_ptov
.BI "(unsigned int phys_addr "  ","
.BI "unsigned int fn "  ","
.BI "unsigned int sz "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "phys_addr" 12
the physical EEPROM address
.IP "fn" 12
the PCI function number
.IP "sz" 12
size of function-specific area
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Translate a physical EEPROM address to virtual.  The first 1K is
accessed through virtual addresses starting at 31K, the rest is
accessed through virtual addresses starting at 0.

The mapping is as follows:
[0..1K) -> [31K..32K)
[1K..1K+A) -> [31K-A..31K)
[1K+A..ES) -> [0..ES-A-1K)

where A = \fIfn\fP * \fIsz\fP, and ES = EEPROM size.
