.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" ssam_request_sync_free
.BI "(struct ssam_request_sync *rqst "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS

The request to be freed.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Free a synchronous request and its corresponding buffer allocated with
\fBssam_request_sync_alloc\fP. Do not use for requests allocated on the stack
or via any other function.

Warning: The caller must ensure that the request is not in use any more.
I.e. the caller must ensure that it has the only reference to the request
and the request is not currently pending. This means that the caller has
either never submitted the request, request submission has failed, or the
caller has waited until the submitted request has been completed via
\fBssam_request_sync_wait\fP.
