write-buffer to synchronize
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function synchronizes write-buffer \fIbuf\fP and returns zero in case of
success or a negative error code in case of failure.

Note, although write-buffers are of \fIc->max_write_size\fP, this function does
not necessarily writes all \fIc->max_write_size\fP bytes to the flash. Instead,
if the write-buffer is only partially filled with data, only the used part
of the write-buffer (aligned on \fIc->min_io_size\fP boundary) is synchronized.
This way we waste less space.
