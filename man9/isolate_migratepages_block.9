.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Isolate all pages that can be migrated from the range specified by
[low_pfn, end_pfn). The range is expected to be within same pageblock.
Returns zero if there is a fatal signal pending, otherwise PFN of the
first page that was not scanned (which may be both less, equal to or more
than end_pfn).

The pages are isolated on cc->migratepages list (not required to be empty),
and cc->nr_migratepages is updated accordingly. The cc->migrate_pfn field
is neither read nor updated.
