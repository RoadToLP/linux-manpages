.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "codec_dai" 12
the codec DAI
.IP "clk_id" 12
the clock ID (ignored)
.IP "freq" 12
the MCLK input frequency
.IP "dir" 12

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The value of MCLK is used to determine which sample rates are supported
by the STA350, based on the mcs_ratio_table.

This function must be called by the machine driver's 'startup' function,
otherwise the list of supported sample rates will not be available in
time for ALSA.
