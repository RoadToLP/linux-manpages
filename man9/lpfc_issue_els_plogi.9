.SH NAME
lpfc_issue_els_plogi \- Issue an plogi iocb command for a vport
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" lpfc_issue_els_plogi
.BI "(struct lpfc_vport *vport "  ","
.BI "uint32_t did "  ","
.BI "uint8_t retry "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "vport" 12
pointer to a host virtual N_Port data structure.
.IP "did" 12
destination port identifier.
.IP "retry" 12
number of retries to the command IOCB.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This routine issues a Port Login (PLOGI) command to a remote N_Port
(with the \fIdid\fP) for a \fIvport\fP. Before issuing a PLOGI to a remote N_Port,
the ndlp with the remote N_Port DID must exist on the \fIvport\fP's ndlp list.
This routine constructs the proper fields of the PLOGI IOCB and invokes
the \fBlpfc_sli_issue_iocb\fP routine to send out PLOGI ELS command.

Note that the ndlp reference count will be incremented by 1 for holding
the ndlp and the reference to ndlp will be stored into the context1 field
of the IOCB for the completion callback function to the PLOGI ELS command.

Return code
0 - Successfully issued a plogi for \fIvport\fP
1 - failed to issue a plogi for \fIvport\fP
