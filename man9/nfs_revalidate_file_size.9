.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Revalidates the file length. This is basically a wrapper around
\fBnfs_revalidate_inode\fP that takes into account the fact that we may
have cached writes (in which case we don't care about the server's
idea of what the file length is), or O_DIRECT (in which case we
shouldn't trust the cache).
