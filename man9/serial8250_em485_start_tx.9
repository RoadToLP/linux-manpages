.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Generic callback usable by 8250 uart drivers to start rs485 transmission.
Assumes that setting the RTS bit in the MCR register means RTS is high.
(Some chips use inverse semantics.)  Further assumes that reception is
stoppable by disabling the UART_IER_RDI interrupt.  (Some chips set the
UART_LSR_DR bit even when UART_IER_RDI is disabled, foiling this approach.)
