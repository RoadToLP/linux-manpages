"A task aborted status (TAS) bit set to zero specifies that
aborted commands shall be terminated by the device server
without any response to the application client. A TAS bit set
to one specifies that commands aborted by the actions of an I_T
nexus other than the I_T nexus on which the command was
received shall be completed with TASK ABORTED status."
