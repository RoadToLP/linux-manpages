.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" it821x_port_start

.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "ap" 12
ATA port being set up

The it821x needs to maintain private data structures and also to
use the standard PCI interface which lacks support for this
functionality. We instead set up the private data on the port
start hook, and tear it down on port stop
