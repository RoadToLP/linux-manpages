.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Before any memory access through an FCP is performed by a module, the FCP
must be enabled by a call to this function. The enable calls are reference
counted, each successful call must be followed by one \fBrcar_fcp_disable\fP
call when no more memory transfer can occur through the FCP.

Return 0 on success or a negative error code if an error occurs. The enable
reference count isn't increased when this function returns an error.
