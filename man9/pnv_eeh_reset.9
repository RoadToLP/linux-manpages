.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Do reset on the indicated PE. For PCI bus sensitive PE,
we need to reset the parent p2p bridge. The PHB has to
be reinitialized if the p2p bridge is root bridge. For
PCI device sensitive PE, we will try to reset the device
through FLR. For now, we don't have OPAL APIs to do HARD
reset yet, so all reset would be SOFT (HOT) reset.
