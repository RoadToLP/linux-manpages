SUCCESS does not necessarily indicate that the command
has been aborted; it only indicates that the LLDDs
has cleared all references to that command.
LLDDs should return FAILED only if an abort was required
but could not be executed. LLDDs should return FAST_IO_FAIL
if the device is temporarily unavailable (eg due to a
link down on FibreChannel)
