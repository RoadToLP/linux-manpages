.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "pvec" 12
Where the resulting pages are placed
.IP "mapping" 12
The address_space to search
.IP "start" 12
The starting page index
.IP "end" 12
The final page index
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBpagevec_lookup_range\fP will search for & return a group of up to PAGEVEC_SIZE
pages in the mapping starting from index \fIstart\fP and upto index \fIend\fP
(inclusive).  The pages are placed in \fIpvec\fP.  \fBpagevec_lookup\fP takes a
reference against the pages in \fIpvec\fP.

The search returns a group of mapping-contiguous pages with ascending
indexes.  There may be holes in the indices due to not-present pages. We
also update \fIstart\fP to index the next page for the traversal.

\fBpagevec_lookup_range\fP returns the number of pages which were found. If this
number is smaller than PAGEVEC_SIZE, the end of specified range has been
reached.
