.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Calling this function will cause the regulator API to disable all
regulators which have a zero use count and don't have an always_on
constraint in a late_initcall.

The intention is that this will become the default behaviour in a
future kernel release so users are encouraged to use this facility
now.
