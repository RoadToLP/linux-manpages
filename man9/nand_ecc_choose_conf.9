nand_ecc_choose_conf \- Set the ECC strength and ECC step size
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" nand_ecc_choose_conf
.BI "(struct nand_chip *chip "  ","
.BI "const struct nand_ecc_caps *caps "  ","
.BI "int oobavail "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "chip" 12
nand chip info structure
.IP "caps" 12
ECC engine caps info structure
.IP "oobavail" 12
OOB size that the ECC engine can use
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Choose the ECC configuration according to following logic.

1. If both ECC step size and ECC strength are already set (usually by DT)
then check if it is supported by this controller.
2. If the user provided the nand-ecc-maximize property, then select maximum
ECC strength.
3. Otherwise, try to match the ECC step size and ECC strength closest
to the chip's requirement. If available OOB size can't fit the chip
requirement then fallback to the maximum ECC step size and ECC strength.

On success, the chosen ECC settings are set.
