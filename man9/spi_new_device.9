.SH NAME

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "struct spi_device *" spi_new_device
.BI "(struct spi_controller *ctlr "  ","
.BI "struct spi_board_info *chip "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "ctlr" 12
Controller to which device is connected
.IP "chip" 12

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
On typical mainboards, this is purely internal; and it's not needed
after board init creates the hard-wired devices.  Some development
platforms may not be able to use spi_register_board_info though, and
this is exported so that for example a USB or parport based adapter
driver could add devices (which it would learn about out-of-band).
.SH "RETURN"
the new device, or NULL.
