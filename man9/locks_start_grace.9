.SH "DESCRIPTION"
A grace period is a period during which locks should not be given
out.  Currently grace periods are only enforced by the two lock
managers (lockd and nfsd), using the \fBlocks_in_grace\fP function to
check when they are in a grace period.

This function is called to start a grace period.
