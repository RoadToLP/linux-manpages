.SH NAME
bmap \- find a block number in a file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" bmap
.BI "(struct inode *inode "  ","
.BI "sector_t *block "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "inode" 12
inode owning the block number being requested
.IP "block" 12
pointer containing the block to find

Replaces the value in ``*block`` with the block number on the device holding
corresponding to the requested block number in the file.
That is, asked for block 4 of inode 1 the function will replace the
4 in ``*block``, with disk block relative to the disk start that holds that
block of the file.

Returns -EINVAL in case of error, 0 otherwise. If mapping falls into a
hole, returns 0 and ``*block`` is also set to 0.
