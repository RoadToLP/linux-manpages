.SH NAME
iommu_sva_bind_device \- Bind a process address space to a device
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "struct iommu_sva *" iommu_sva_bind_device
.BI "(struct device *dev "  ","
.BI "struct mm_struct *mm "  ","
.BI "void *drvdata "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dev" 12
the device
.IP "mm" 12
the mm to bind, caller must hold a reference to it
.IP "drvdata" 12
-- undescribed --
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Create a bond between device and address space, allowing the device to access
the mm using the returned PASID. If a bond already exists between \fIdevice\fP and
\fImm\fP, it is returned and an additional reference is taken. Caller must call
\fBiommu_sva_unbind_device\fP to release each reference.

iommu_dev_enable_feature(dev, IOMMU_DEV_FEAT_SVA) must be called first, to
initialize the required SVA features.

On error, returns an ERR_PTR value.
