.SH NAME
t4_change_mac \- modifies the exact-match filter for a MAC address
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" t4_change_mac
.BI "(struct adapter *adap "  ","
.BI "unsigned int mbox "  ","
.BI "unsigned int viid "  ","
.BI "int idx "  ","
.BI "const u8 *addr "  ","
.BI "bool persist "  ","
.BI "u8 *smt_idx "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "adap" 12
the adapter
.IP "mbox" 12
mailbox to use for the FW command
.IP "viid" 12
the VI id
.IP "idx" 12
index of existing filter for old value of MAC address, or -1
.IP "addr" 12
the new MAC address value
.IP "persist" 12
whether a new MAC allocation should be persistent
.IP "smt_idx" 12
the destination to store the new SMT index.

Modifies an exact-match filter and sets it to the new MAC address.
Note that in general it is not possible to modify the value of a given
filter so the generic way to modify an address filter is to free the one
being used by the old address value and allocate a new filter for the
new address value.  \fIidx\fP can be -1 if the address is a new addition.

Returns a negative error number or the index of the filter with the new
MAC value.
