.SH "DESCRIPTION"
A native bus (eg Runway or GSC) may have up to 64 devices on it,
spaced at intervals of 0x1000 bytes.  PDC may not inform us of these
devices, so we have to probe for them.  Unfortunately, we may find
devices which are not physically connected (such as extra serial &
keyboard ports).  This problem is not yet solved.
