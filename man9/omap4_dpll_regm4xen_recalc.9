.SH NAME
omap4_dpll_regm4xen_recalc \- compute DPLL rate, considering REGM4XEN bit
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "unsigned long" omap4_dpll_regm4xen_recalc
.BI "(struct clk_hw *hw "  ","
.BI "unsigned long parent_rate "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "hw" 12
pointer to the clock to compute the rate for
.IP "parent_rate" 12
clock rate of the DPLL parent
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Compute the output rate for the OMAP4 DPLL represented by \fIclk\fP.
Takes the REGM4XEN bit into consideration, which is needed for the
OMAP4 ABE DPLL.  Returns the DPLL's output rate (before M-dividers)
upon success, or 0 upon error.
