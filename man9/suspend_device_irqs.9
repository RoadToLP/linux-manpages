.SH "DESCRIPTION"

During system-wide suspend or hibernation device drivers need to be
prevented from receiving interrupts and this function is provided
for this purpose.

So we disable all interrupts and mark them IRQS_SUSPENDED except
for those which are unused, those which are marked as not
suspendable via an interrupt request with the flag IRQF_NO_SUSPEND
set and those which are marked as active wakeup sources.

The active wakeup sources are handled by the flow handler entry
code which checks for the IRQD_WAKEUP_ARMED flag, suspends the
interrupt and notifies the pm core about the wakeup.
