.SH NAME
drm_get_last_vbltimestamp \- retrieve raw timestamp for the most recent vblank interval
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "bool" drm_get_last_vbltimestamp
.BI "(struct drm_device *dev "  ","
.BI "unsigned int pipe "  ","
.BI "ktime_t *tvblank "  ","
.BI "bool in_vblank_irq "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dev" 12
DRM device
.IP "pipe" 12
index of CRTC whose vblank timestamp to retrieve
.IP "tvblank" 12
Pointer to target time which should receive the timestamp
.IP "in_vblank_irq" 12
True when called from \fBdrm_crtc_handle_vblank\fP.  Some drivers
need to apply some workarounds for gpu-specific vblank irq quirks
if flag is set.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Fetches the system timestamp corresponding to the time of the most recent
vblank interval on specified CRTC. May call into kms-driver to
compute the timestamp with a high-precision GPU specific method.

Returns zero if timestamp originates from uncorrected \fBdo_gettimeofday\fP
call, i.e., it isn't very precisely locked to the true vblank.
.SH "RETURN"
True if timestamp is considered to be very precise, false otherwise.
