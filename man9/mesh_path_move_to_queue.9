.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gate_mpath" 12
An active mpath the frames will be sent to (i.e. the gate)
.IP "from_mpath" 12
The failed mpath
.IP "copy" 12

.SH "DESCRIPTION"

This function is used to transfer or copy frames from an unresolved mpath to
a gate mpath.  The function also adds the Address Extension field and
updates the next hop.

If a frame already has an Address Extension field, only the next hop and
destination addresses are updated.

The gate mpath must be an active mpath with a valid mpath->next_hop.
