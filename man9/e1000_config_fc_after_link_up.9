Configures flow control settings after link is established
Should be called immediately after a valid link has been established.
Forces MAC flow control settings if link was forced. When in MII/GMII mode
and autonegotiation is enabled, the MAC flow control settings will be set
based on the flow control negotiated by the PHY. In TBI mode, the TFCE
and RFCE bits will be automatically set to the negotiated flow control mode.
