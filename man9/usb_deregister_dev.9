Used in conjunction with \fBusb_register_dev\fP.  This function is called
when the USB driver is finished with the minor numbers gotten from a
call to \fBusb_register_dev\fP (usually when the device is disconnected
from the system.)

This function also removes the usb class device from the sysfs tree.

This should be called by all drivers that use the USB major number.
