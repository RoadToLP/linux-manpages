.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" cgroup_apply_control_disable
.BI "(struct cgroup *cgrp "  ");"

root of the target subtree
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Walk \fIcgrp\fP's subtree and kill and hide csses so that they match
\fBcgroup_ss_mask\fP and \fBcgroup_visible_mask\fP.

A css is hidden when the userland requests it to be disabled while other
subsystems are still depending on it.  The css must not actively control
resources and be in the vanilla state if it's made visible again later.
Controllers which may be depended upon should provide ->\fBcss_reset\fP for
this purpose.
