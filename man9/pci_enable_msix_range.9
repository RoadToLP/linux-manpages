.BI "struct msix_entry *entries "  ","
.BI "int minvec "  ","
.BI "int maxvec "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dev" 12
pointer to the pci_dev data structure of MSI-X device function
.IP "entries" 12
pointer to an array of MSI-X entries
.IP "minvec" 12
minimum number of MSI-X IRQs requested
.IP "maxvec" 12
maximum number of MSI-X IRQs requested
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Setup the MSI-X capability structure of device function with a maximum
possible number of interrupts in the range between \fIminvec\fP and \fImaxvec\fP
upon its software driver call to request for MSI-X mode enabled on its
hardware device function. It returns a negative errno if an error occurs.
If it succeeds, it returns the actual number of interrupts allocated and
indicates the successful configuration of MSI-X capability structure
with new allocated MSI-X interrupts.
