.SH "DESCRIPTION"
SMEM is a managed block of shared DRAM, from which numbered "items"
can be allocated.  One item is designated for use by the IPA.

The modem accesses SMEM memory directly, but the IPA accesses it
via the IOMMU, using the AP's credentials.

If size provided is non-zero, we allocate it and map it for
access through the IOMMU.
.SH "NOTE"
\fIsize\fP and the item address are is not guaranteed to be page-aligned.
