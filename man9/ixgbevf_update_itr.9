.SH NAME
ixgbevf_update_itr \- update the dynamic ITR value based on statistics
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" ixgbevf_update_itr
.BI "(struct ixgbevf_q_vector *q_vector "  ","
.BI "struct ixgbevf_ring_container *ring_container "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "q_vector" 12
structure containing interrupt and ring information
.IP "ring_container" 12
structure containing ring performance data
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Stores a new ITR value based on packets and byte
counts during the last interrupt.  The advantage of per interrupt
computation is faster updates and more accurate ITR for the current
traffic pattern.  Constants in this function were computed
based on theoretical maximum wire speed and thresholds were set based
on testing data as well as attempting to minimize response time
while increasing bulk throughput.
