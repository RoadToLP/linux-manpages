.SH NAME
i2c_verify_adapter \- return parameter as i2c_adapter or NULL
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "struct i2c_adapter *" i2c_verify_adapter
.BI "(struct device *dev "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dev" 12
device, probably from some driver model iterator
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
When traversing the driver model tree, perhaps using driver model
iterators like \fI\fP\fBdevice_for_each_child\fP, you can't assume very much
about the nodes you find.  Use this function to avoid oopses caused
by wrongly treating some non-I2C device as an i2c_adapter.
