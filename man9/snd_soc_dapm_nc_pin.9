.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Marks the specified pin as being not connected, disabling it along
any parent or child widgets.  At present this is identical to
\fBsnd_soc_dapm_disable_pin\fP but in future it will be extended to do
additional things such as disabling controls which only affect
paths through the pin.
.SH "NOTE"
\fBsnd_soc_dapm_sync\fP needs to be called after this for DAPM to
do any widget power switching.
