The keyslot manager to init
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Initialize a passthrough keyslot manager.
Called by e.g. storage drivers to set up a keyslot manager in their
request_queue, when the storage driver wants to manage its keys by itself.
This is useful for inline encryption hardware that doesn't have the concept
of keyslots, and for layered devices.
