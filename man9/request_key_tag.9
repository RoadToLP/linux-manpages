.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "type" 12
Type of key.
.IP "description" 12
The searchable description of the key.
.IP "domain_tag" 12
The domain in which the key operates.
.IP "callout_info" 12
The data to pass to the instantiation upcall (or NULL).
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
As for \fBrequest_key_and_link\fP except that it does not add the returned key
to a keyring if found, new keys are always allocated in the user's quota,
the callout_info must be a NUL-terminated string and no auxiliary data can
be passed.

Furthermore, it then works as \fBwait_for_key_construction\fP to wait for the
completion of keys undergoing construction with a non-interruptible wait.
