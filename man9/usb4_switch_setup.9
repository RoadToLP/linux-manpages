USB4 router to setup
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
USB4 routers need additional settings in order to enable all the
tunneling. This function enables USB and PCIe tunneling if it can be
enabled (e.g the parent switch also supports them). If USB tunneling
is not available for some reason (like that there is Thunderbolt 3
switch upstream) then the internal xHCI controller is enabled
instead.
