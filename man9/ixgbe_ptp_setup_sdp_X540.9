.SH "DESCRIPTION"
this function enables or disables the clock out feature on SDP0 for
the X540 device. It will create a 1 second periodic output that can
be used as the PPS (via an interrupt).

It calculates when the system time will be on an exact second, and then
aligns the start of the PPS signal to that value.

This works by using the cycle counter shift and mult values in reverse, and
assumes that the values we're shifting will not overflow.
