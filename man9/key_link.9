.SH NAME
key_link \- Link a key to a keyring
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" key_link
.BI "(struct key *keyring "  ","
.BI "struct key *key "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "keyring" 12
The keyring to make the link in.
.IP "key" 12
The key to link to.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Make a link in a keyring to a key, such that the keyring holds a reference
on that key and the key can potentially be found by searching that keyring.

This function will write-lock the keyring's semaphore and will consume some
of the user's key data quota to hold the link.

Returns 0 if successful, -ENOTDIR if the keyring isn't a keyring,
-EKEYREVOKED if the keyring has been revoked, -ENFILE if the keyring is
full, -EDQUOT if there is insufficient key data quota remaining to add
another link or -ENOMEM if there's insufficient memory.

It is assumed that the caller has checked that it is permitted for a link to
be made (the keyring should have Write permission and the key Link
permission).
