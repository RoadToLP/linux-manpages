.BI "(struct page *page "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS

called from \fBmunlock\fP/\fBmunmap\fP path with page supposedly on the LRU.
When we munlock a page, because the vma where we found the page is being
\fBmunlock\fPed or \fBmunmap\fPed, we want to check whether other vmas hold the
page locked so that we can leave it on the unevictable lru list and not
bother vmscan with it.  However, to walk the page's rmap list in
\fBtry_to_munlock\fP we must isolate the page from the LRU.  If some other
task has removed the page from the LRU, we won't be able to do that.
So we clear the PageMlocked as we might not get another chance.  If we
can't isolate the page, we leave it for \fBputback_lru_page\fP and vmscan
[\fBpage_referenced\fP/\fBtry_to_unmap\fP] to deal with.
