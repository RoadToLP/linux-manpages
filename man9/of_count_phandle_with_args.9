.SH NAME
of_count_phandle_with_args \- Find the number of phandles references in a property
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" of_count_phandle_with_args
.BI "(const struct device_node *np "  ","
.BI "const char *list_name "  ","
.BI "const char *cells_name "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "np" 12
pointer to a device tree node containing a list
.IP "list_name" 12
property name that contains a list
.IP "cells_name" 12
property name that specifies phandles' arguments count
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Returns the number of phandle + argument tuples within a property. It
is a typical pattern to encode a list of phandle and variable
arguments into a single property. The number of arguments is encoded
by a property in the phandle-target node. For example, a gpios
property would contain a list of GPIO specifies consisting of a
phandle and 1 or more arguments. The number of arguments are
determined by the #gpio-cells property in the node pointed to by the
phandle.
