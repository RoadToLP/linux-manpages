.SH NAME
vsp1_entity_remote_pad \- Find the pad at the remote end of a link
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "struct media_pad *" vsp1_entity_remote_pad
.BI "(struct media_pad *pad "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "pad" 12
Pad at the local end of the link
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Search for a remote pad connected to the given pad by iterating over all
links originating or terminating at that pad until an enabled link is found.

Our link setup implementation guarantees that the output fan-out will not be
higher than one for the data pipelines, except for the links to the HGO and
HGT that can be enabled in addition to a regular data link. When traversing
outgoing links this function ignores HGO and HGT entities and should thus be
used in place of the generic \fBmedia_entity_remote_pad\fP function to traverse
data pipelines.

Return a pointer to the pad at the remote end of the first found enabled
link, or NULL if no enabled link has been found.
