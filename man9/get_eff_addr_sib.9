.IP "eff_addr" 12
Obtained effective address
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Obtain the effective address referenced by the SIB byte of \fIinsn\fP. After
identifying the registers involved in the indexed, register-indirect memory
reference, its value is obtained from the operands in \fIregs\fP. The computed
address is stored \fIeff_addr\fP. Also, the register operand that indicates the
associated segment is stored in \fIregoff\fP, this parameter can later be used to
determine such segment.

0 on success. \fIeff_addr\fP will have the referenced effective address.
\fIbase_offset\fP will have a register, as an offset from the base of pt_regs,
that can be used to resolve the associated segment.

-EINVAL on error.
