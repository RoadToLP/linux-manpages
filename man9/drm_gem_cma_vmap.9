.SH NAME
drm_gem_cma_vmap \- map a CMA GEM object into the kernel's virtual address space
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" drm_gem_cma_vmap
.BI "(struct drm_gem_object *obj "  ","
.BI "struct dma_buf_map *map "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "obj" 12
GEM object
.IP "map" 12
Returns the kernel virtual address of the CMA GEM object's backing
store.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function maps a buffer into the kernel's
virtual address space. Since the CMA buffers are already mapped into the
kernel virtual address space this simply returns the cached virtual
address. Drivers using the CMA helpers should set this as their DRM
driver's \fIdrm_gem_object_funcs.vmap\fP callback.
.SH "RETURN"
0 on success, or a negative error code otherwise.
