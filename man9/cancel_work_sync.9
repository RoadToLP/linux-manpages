.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "bool" cancel_work_sync
.BI "(struct work_struct *work "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "work" 12
the work to cancel
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Cancel \fIwork\fP and wait for its execution to finish.  This function
can be used even if the work re-queues itself or migrates to
another workqueue.  On return from this function, \fIwork\fP is
guaranteed to be not pending or executing on any CPU.

cancel_work_sync(\fIdelayed_work->work\fP) must not be used for
delayed_work's.  Use \fBcancel_delayed_work_sync\fP instead.

The caller must ensure that the workqueue on which \fIwork\fP was last
queued can't be destroyed before this function returns.
.SH "RETURN"
true if \fIwork\fP was pending, false otherwise.
