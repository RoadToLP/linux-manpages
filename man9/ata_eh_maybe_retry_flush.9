.SH NAME
ata_eh_maybe_retry_flush \- Retry FLUSH if necessary
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" ata_eh_maybe_retry_flush
.BI "(struct ata_device *dev "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dev" 12
ATA device which may need FLUSH retry

If \fIdev\fP failed FLUSH, it needs to be reported upper layer
immediately as it means that \fIdev\fP failed to remap and already
lost at least a sector and further FLUSH retrials won't make
any difference to the lost sector.  However, if FLUSH failed
for other reasons, for example transmission error, FLUSH needs
to be retried.

This function determines whether FLUSH failure retry is
necessary and performs it if so.
.SH "RETURN"
0 if EH can continue, -errno if EH needs to be repeated.
