.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Add a display list body to a display list. Registers contained in bodies are
processed after registers contained in the main display list, in the order in
which bodies are added.

Adding a body to a display list passes ownership of the body to the list. The
caller retains its reference to the body when adding it to the display list,
but is not allowed to add new entries to the body.

The reference must be explicitly released by a call to \fBvsp1_dl_body_put\fP
when the body isn't needed anymore.
