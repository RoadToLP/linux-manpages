.SH NAME
drm_crtc_vblank_helper_get_vblank_timestamp \- precise vblank timestamp helper
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "bool" drm_crtc_vblank_helper_get_vblank_timestamp
.BI "(struct drm_crtc *crtc "  ","
.BI "int *max_error "  ","
.BI "ktime_t *vblank_time "  ","
.BI "bool in_vblank_irq "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "crtc" 12
CRTC whose vblank timestamp to retrieve
.IP "max_error" 12
Desired maximum allowable error in timestamps (nanosecs)
On return contains true maximum error of timestamp
.IP "vblank_time" 12
Pointer to time which should receive the timestamp
.IP "in_vblank_irq" 12
True when called from \fBdrm_crtc_handle_vblank\fP.  Some drivers
need to apply some workarounds for gpu-specific vblank irq quirks
if flag is set.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Implements calculation of exact vblank timestamps from given drm_display_mode
timings and current video scanout position of a CRTC. This can be directly
used as the \fIdrm_crtc_funcs.get_vblank_timestamp\fP implementation of a kms
driver if \fIdrm_crtc_helper_funcs.get_scanout_position\fP is implemented.

The current implementation only handles standard video modes. For double scan
and interlaced modes the driver is supposed to adjust the hardware mode
(taken from \fIdrm_crtc_state.adjusted\fP mode for atomic modeset drivers) to
match the scanout position reported.

Note that atomic drivers must call \fBdrm_calc_timestamping_constants\fP before
enabling a CRTC. The atomic helpers already take care of that in
\fBdrm_atomic_helper_calc_timestamping_constants\fP.

Returns true on success, and false on failure, i.e. when no accurate
timestamp could be acquired.
