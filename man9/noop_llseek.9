.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This is an implementation of ->llseek useable for the rare special case when
userspace expects the seek to succeed but the (device) file is actually not
able to perform the seek. In this case you use \fBnoop_llseek\fP instead of
falling back to the default implementation of ->llseek.
