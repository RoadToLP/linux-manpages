.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function is used to iterate an ulist.
It returns the next element from the ulist or NULL when the
end is reached. No guarantee is made with respect to the order in which
the elements are returned. They might neither be returned in order of
addition nor in ascending order.
It is allowed to call ulist_add during an enumeration. Newly added items
are guaranteed to show up in the running enumeration.
