.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" ibm_get_table_from_acpi
.BI "(char **bufp "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This method reads the APLS buffer in from ACPI and
stores the "stripped" table into a single buffer
it allocates and passes the address back in bufp.

If NULL is passed in as buffer, this method only calculates
the size of the table and returns that without filling
in the buffer.

Returns < 0 on error or the size of the table on success.
