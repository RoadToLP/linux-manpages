.BI "(struct input_dev *dev "  ","
.BI "unsigned int type "  ","
.BI "unsigned int code "  ","

.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dev" 12
device that generated the event
.IP "type" 12
type of the event
.IP "code" 12

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function should be used by drivers implementing various input
devices to report input events. See also \fBinput_inject_event\fP.
.SH "NOTE"
\fBinput_event\fP may be safely used right after input device was
allocated with \fBinput_allocate_device\fP, even before it is registered
with \fBinput_register_device\fP, but the event will not reach any of the
input handlers. Such early invocation of \fBinput_event\fP may be used
to 'seed' initial state of a switch or initial position of absolute
axis, etc.
