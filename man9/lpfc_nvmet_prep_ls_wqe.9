.SH NAME
lpfc_nvmet_prep_ls_wqe \- Allocate and prepare a lpfc wqe data structure
.SH SYNOPSIS

.BI "(struct lpfc_hba *phba "  ","
.BI "struct lpfc_async_xchg_ctx *ctxp "  ","

.BI "uint16_t rspsize "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "phba" 12
pointer to a host N_Port data structure.
.IP "ctxp" 12
Context info for NVME LS Request
.IP "rspbuf" 12
DMA buffer of NVME command.
.IP "rspsize" 12
size of the NVME command.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This routine is used for allocating a lpfc-WQE data structure from
the driver lpfc-WQE free-list and prepare the WQE with the parameters
passed into the routine for discovery state machine to issue an Extended
Link Service (NVME) commands. It is a generic lpfc-WQE allocation
and preparation routine that is used by all the discovery state machine
routines and the NVME command-specific fields will be later set up by
the individual discovery machine routines after calling this routine
allocating and preparing a generic WQE data structure. It fills in the
Buffer Descriptor Entries (BDEs), allocates buffers for both command
payload and response payload (if expected). The reference count on the
ndlp is incremented by 1 and the reference to the ndlp is put into
context1 of the WQE data structure for this WQE to hold the ndlp
reference for the command's callback function to access later.

Return code
Pointer to the newly allocated/prepared nvme wqe data structure
NULL - when nvme wqe data structure allocation/preparation failed
