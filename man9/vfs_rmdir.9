.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "mnt_userns" 12
user namespace of the mount the inode was found from
.IP "dir" 12
inode of \fIdentry\fP
.IP "dentry" 12
pointer to dentry of the base directory
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Remove a directory.

If the inode has been found through an idmapped mount the user namespace of
the vfsmount must be passed through \fImnt_userns\fP. This function will then take
care to map the inode according to \fImnt_userns\fP before checking permissions.
On non-idmapped mounts or if permission checking is to be performed on the
raw inode simply passs init_user_ns.
