Each time a resource is put on the validation list as the result of a
view pointing to it, we need to determine whether that resource will
be dirtied (written to by the GPU) as a result of the corresponding

access views are capable of dirtying its resource.

Whether the view type of \fIres\fP dirties the resource it points to.
