.SH NAME
_pwrdm_save_clkdm_state_and_activate \- prepare for power state change
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "u8" _pwrdm_save_clkdm_state_and_activate
.BI "(struct powerdomain *pwrdm "  ","
.BI "u8 curr_pwrst "  ","
.BI "u8 pwrst "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "pwrdm" 12
struct powerdomain * to operate on
.IP "curr_pwrst" 12
current power state of \fIpwrdm\fP
.IP "pwrst" 12
power state to switch to
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Determine whether the powerdomain needs to be turned on before
attempting to switch power states.  Called by
\fBomap_set_pwrdm_state\fP.  NOTE that if the powerdomain contains
multiple clockdomains, this code assumes that the first clockdomain
supports software-supervised wakeup mode - potentially a problem.
Returns the power state switch mode currently in use (see the
"Types of sleep_switch" comment above).
