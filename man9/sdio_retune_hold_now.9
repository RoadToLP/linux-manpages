SDIO function attached to host

This function can be called if it's currently a bad time to do
a retune of the SDIO card.  Retune requests made during this time
will be held and we'll actually do the retune sometime after the
release.

This function could be useful if an SDIO card is in a power state
where it can respond to a small subset of commands that doesn't
include the retuning command.  Care should be taken when using
this function since (presumably) the retuning request we might be
deferring was made for a good reason.

This function should be called while the host is claimed.
