reset control
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This is used to explicitly acquire a reset control for exclusive use. Note
that exclusive resets are requested as acquired by default. In order for a
second consumer to be able to control the reset, the first consumer has to
release it first. Typically the easiest way to achieve this is to call the
\fBreset_control_get_exclusive_released\fP to obtain an instance of the reset
control. Such reset controls are not acquired by default.

Consumers implementing shared access to an exclusive reset need to follow
a specific protocol in order to work together. Before consumers can change
a reset they must acquire exclusive access using \fBreset_control_acquire\fP.
After they are done operating the reset, they must release exclusive access
with a call to \fBreset_control_release\fP. Consumers are not granted exclusive
access to the reset as long as another consumer hasn't released a reset.
