.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "symsize" 12
the symbol size (number of bits)
.IP "gfpoly" 12
the extended Galois field generator polynomial coefficients,
with the 0th coefficient in the low order bit. The polynomial
must be primitive;
.IP "fcr" 12
the first consecutive root of the rs code generator polynomial
in index form
.IP "prim" 12
primitive element to generate polynomial roots
.IP "nroots" 12
RS code generator polynomial degree (number of roots)
.IP "gfp" 12
Memory allocation flags.
