.SH NAME
pci_update_current_state \- Read power state of given device and cache it
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" pci_update_current_state
.BI "(struct pci_dev *dev "  ","
.BI "pci_power_t state "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dev" 12
PCI device to handle.
.IP "state" 12
State to cache in case the device doesn't have the PM capability
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The power state is read from the PMCSR register, which however is
inaccessible in D3cold.  The platform firmware is therefore queried first
to detect accessibility of the register.  In case the platform firmware
reports an incorrect state or the device isn't power manageable by the
platform at all, we try to detect D3cold by testing accessibility of the
vendor ID in config space.
