.BI "(struct list_head *work_q "  ","
.BI "struct list_head *done_q "  ");"

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
See if we need to request sense information.  if so, then get it
now, so we have a better idea of what to do.
.SH "NOTES"
This has the unfortunate side effect that if a shost adapter does
not automatically request sense information, we end up shutting
it down before we request it.

All drivers should request sense information internally these days,
so for now all I have to say is tough noogies if you end up in here.

XXX: Long term this code should go away, but that needs an audit of
all LLDDs first.
