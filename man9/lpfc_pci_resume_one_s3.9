.SH SYNOPSIS

pointer to device
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This routine is to be called from the kernel's PCI subsystem to support
system Power Management (PM) to device with SLI-3 interface spec. When PM
invokes this method, it restores the device's PCI config space state and
fully reinitializes the device and brings it online. Note that as the
driver implements the minimum PM requirements to a power-aware driver's
PM for suspend/resume -- all the possible PM messages (SUSPEND, HIBERNATE,
FREEZE) to the \fBsuspend\fP method call will be treated as SUSPEND and the
driver will fully reinitialize its device during \fBresume\fP method call,
the device will be set to PCI_D0 directly in PCI config space before
restoring the state.

Return code
0 - driver suspended the device
Error otherwise
