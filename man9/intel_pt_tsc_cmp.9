.SH NAME
intel_pt_tsc_cmp \- compare 7-byte TSCs.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" intel_pt_tsc_cmp
.BI "(uint64_t tsc1 "  ","
.BI "uint64_t tsc2 "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "tsc1" 12
first TSC to compare
.IP "tsc2" 12
second TSC to compare
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function compares 7-byte TSC values allowing for the possibility that
TSC wrapped around.  Generally it is not possible to know if TSC has wrapped
around so for that purpose this function assumes the absolute difference is
less than half the maximum difference.
.SH "RETURN"
-1 if \fItsc1\fP is before \fItsc2\fP, 0 if \fItsc1\fP == \fItsc2\fP, 1 if \fItsc1\fP is
after \fItsc2\fP.
