.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "nd_region" 12
constrain available space check to this reference region
.IP "nd_mapping" 12
container of dpa-resource-root + labels
.IP "overlap" 12
calculate available space assuming this level of overlap
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Validate that a PMEM label, if present, aligns with the start of an
interleave set and truncate the available size at the lowest BLK
overlap point.

The expectation is that this routine is called multiple times as it
probes for the largest BLK encroachment for any single member DIMM of
the interleave set.  Once that value is determined the PMEM-limit for
the set can be established.
