.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Inform regcache that the device has been powered down or reset, so that
on resume, \fBregcache_sync\fP knows to write out all non-default values
stored in the cache.

If this function is not called, \fBregcache_sync\fP will assume that
the hardware state still matches the cache state, modulo any writes that
happened when cache_only was true.
