drm_atomic_get_plane_state \- get plane state
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "struct drm_plane_state *" drm_atomic_get_plane_state
.BI "(struct drm_atomic_state *state "  ","
.BI "struct drm_plane *plane "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "state" 12
global atomic state object
.IP "plane" 12
plane to get state object for
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function returns the plane state for the given plane, allocating it if
needed. It will also grab the relevant plane lock to make sure that the state
is consistent.

Either the allocated state or the error code encoded into the pointer. When
the error is EDEADLK then the w/w mutex code has detected a deadlock and the
entire atomic sequence must be restarted. All other errors are fatal.
