.SH NAME
device_unregister \- unregister device from system.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" device_unregister
.BI "(struct device *dev "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dev" 12
device going away.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
We do this in two parts, like we do \fBdevice_register\fP. First,
we remove it from all the subsystems with \fBdevice_del\fP, then
we decrement the reference count via \fBput_device\fP. If that
is the final reference count, the device will be cleaned up
via \fBdevice_release\fP above. Otherwise, the structure will
stick around until the final reference to the device is dropped.
