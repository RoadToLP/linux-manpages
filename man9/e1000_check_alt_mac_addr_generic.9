Checks the nvm for an alternate MAC address.  An alternate MAC address
can be setup by pre-boot software and must be treated like a permanent
address and must override the actual permanent MAC address. If an
alternate MAC address is found it is programmed into RAR0, replacing
the permanent address that was installed into RAR0 by the Si on reset.
This function will return SUCCESS unless it encounters an error while
reading the EEPROM.
