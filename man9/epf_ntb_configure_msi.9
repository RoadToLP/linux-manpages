PCI Address Space
(Managed by HOST2)


This function performs stage (B) in the above diagram (see Doorbell 1,
Doorbell 2, Doorbell 3, Doorbell 4) i.e map OB address space corresponding to
doorbell to MSI address in PCI address space.

This operation requires 3 parameters
1) Address reserved for doorbell in the outbound address space
2) MSI-X address in the PCIe Address space
3) Number of MSI-X interrupts that has to be configured

The address in the outbound address space (for the Doorbell) is stored in
epf_bar corresponding to BAR_DB_MW1 of epf_ntb_epc that is connected to
HOST1. This is populated in \fBepf_ntb_alloc_peer_mem\fP in this driver along
with address for MW1.

\fBpci_epc_map_msi_irq\fP takes the MSI address from MSI capability register
and maps the OB address (obtained in \fBepf_ntb_alloc_peer_mem\fP) to the MSI
address.

\fBepf_ntb_configure_msi\fP also stores the MSI data to raise each interrupt
in db_data of the peer's control region. This helps the peer to raise
doorbell of the other host by writing db_data to the BAR corresponding to
BAR_DB_MW1.
