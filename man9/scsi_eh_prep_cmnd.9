.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "scmd" 12
SCSI command structure to hijack
.IP "ses" 12
structure to save restore information
.IP "cmnd" 12
CDB to send. Can be NULL if no new cmnd is needed
.IP "cmnd_size" 12
size in bytes of \fIcmnd\fP (must be <= BLK_MAX_CDB)
.IP "sense_bytes" 12
size of sense data to copy. or 0 (if != 0 \fIcmnd\fP is ignored)
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function is used to save a scsi command information before re-execution
as part of the error recovery process.  If \fIsense_bytes\fP is 0 the command
sent must be one that does not transfer any data.  If \fIsense_bytes\fP != 0
\fIcmnd\fP is ignored and this functions sets up a REQUEST_SENSE command
and cmnd buffers to read \fIsense_bytes\fP into \fIscmd->sense_buffer\fP.
