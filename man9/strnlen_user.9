.SH NAME
strnlen_user \- - Get the size of a user string INCLUDING final NUL.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "long" strnlen_user
.BI "(const char __user *str "  ","
.BI "long count "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "str" 12
The string to measure.
.IP "count" 12
Maximum count (including NUL character)
.SH "CONTEXT"
User context only. This function may sleep if pagefaults are
enabled.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Get the size of a NUL-terminated string in user space.

Returns the size of the string INCLUDING the terminating NUL.
If the string is too long, returns a number larger than \fIcount\fP. User
has to check the return value against "> count".
On exception (or invalid count), returns 0.

NOTE! You should basically never use this function. There is
almost never any valid case for using the length of a user space
string, since the string can be changed at any time by other
threads. Use "\fBstrncpy_from_user\fP" instead to get a stable copy
of the string.
