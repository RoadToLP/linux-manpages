.SH "DESCRIPTION"
If REC is supported then just issue it and return. The REC exchange will
complete or time out and recovery can continue at that point. Otherwise,
if the response has been received without all the data it has been
ER_TIMEOUT since the response was received. If the response has not been
received we see if data was received recently. If it has been then we
continue waiting, otherwise, we abort the command.
