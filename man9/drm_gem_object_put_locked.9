.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This releases a reference to \fIobj\fP. Callers must hold the
\fIdrm_device.struct_mutex\fP lock when calling this function, even when the
driver doesn't use \fIdrm_device.struct_mutex\fP for anything.

For drivers not encumbered with legacy locking use
\fBdrm_gem_object_put\fP instead.
