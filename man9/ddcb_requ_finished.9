.SH NAME
ddcb_requ_finished \- Returns the hardware state of the associated DDCB
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" ddcb_requ_finished
.BI "(struct genwqe_dev *cd "  ","
.BI "struct ddcb_requ *req "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "cd" 12
pointer to genwqe device descriptor
.IP "req" 12
DDCB work request
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Status of ddcb_requ mirrors this hardware state, but is copied in
the ddcb_requ on interrupt/polling function. The lowlevel code
should check the hardware state directly, the higher level code
should check the copy.

This function will also return true if the state of the queue is
not GENWQE_CARD_USED. This enables us to purge all DDCBs in the
shutdown case.
