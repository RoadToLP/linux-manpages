.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This call was developed for S700 workstations to allow the kernel to find
the I/O devices (Core I/O). In the future (Kittyhawk and beyond) this
call will be replaced (on workstations) by the architected PDC_SYSTEM_MAP
call.

This call is supported by all existing S700 workstations (up to  Gecko).
