.SH NAME
drm_fb_helper_set_suspend_unlocked \- wrapper around fb_set_suspend that also takes the console lock
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" drm_fb_helper_set_suspend_unlocked
.BI "(struct drm_fb_helper *fb_helper "  ","
.BI "bool suspend "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "fb_helper" 12
driver-allocated fbdev helper, can be NULL
.IP "suspend" 12
whether to suspend or resume
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
A wrapper around \fBfb_set_suspend\fP that takes the console lock. If the lock
isn't available on resume, a worker is tasked with waiting for the lock
to become available. The console lock can be pretty contented on resume
due to all the printk activity.

This function can be called multiple times with the same state since
\fIfb_info.state\fP is checked to see if fbdev is running or not before locking.

Use \fBdrm_fb_helper_set_suspend\fP if you need to take the lock yourself.
