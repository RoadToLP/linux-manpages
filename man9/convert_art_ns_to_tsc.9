.SH NAME
convert_art_ns_to_tsc \- Convert ART in nanoseconds to TSC.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "struct system_counterval_t" convert_art_ns_to_tsc
.BI "(u64 art_ns "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "art_ns" 12
ART (Always Running Timer) in unit of nanoseconds
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
PTM requires all timestamps to be in units of nanoseconds. When user
software requests a cross-timestamp, this function converts system timestamp
to TSC.

This is valid when CPU feature flag X86_FEATURE_TSC_KNOWN_FREQ is set
indicating the tsc_khz is derived from CPUID[15H]. Drivers should check
that this flag is set before conversion to TSC is attempted.
.SH "RETURN"
struct system_counterval_t - system counter value with the pointer to the
corresponding clocksource
