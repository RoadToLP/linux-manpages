.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This functions restores the vblank interrupt state captured with
\fBdrm_crtc_vblank_off\fP again and is generally called when enabling \fIcrtc\fP. Note
that calls to \fBdrm_crtc_vblank_on\fP and \fBdrm_crtc_vblank_off\fP can be
unbalanced and so can also be unconditionally called in driver load code to
reflect the current hardware state of the crtc.
