.SH NAME
spi_controller_dma_map_mem_op_data \- DMA-map the buffer attached to a memory operation
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" spi_controller_dma_map_mem_op_data
.BI "(struct spi_controller *ctlr "  ","
.BI "const struct spi_mem_op *op "  ","
.BI "struct sg_table *sgt "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "ctlr" 12
the SPI controller requesting this \fBdma_map\fP
.IP "op" 12
the memory operation containing the buffer to map
.IP "sgt" 12
a pointer to a non-initialized sg_table that will be filled by this
function
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Some controllers might want to do DMA on the data buffer embedded in \fIop\fP.
This helper prepares everything for you and provides a ready-to-use
sg_table. This function is not intended to be called from spi drivers.
Only SPI controller drivers should use it.
Note that the caller must ensure the memory region pointed by
op->data.buf.{in,out} is DMA-able before calling this function.
.SH "RETURN"
0 in case of success, a negative error code otherwise.
