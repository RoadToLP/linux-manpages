disassociate_ctty \- disconnect controlling tty
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" disassociate_ctty
.BI "(int on_exit "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "on_exit" 12
true if exiting so need to "hang up" the session

This function is typically called only by the session leader, when
it wants to disassociate itself from its controlling tty.

It performs the following functions:
(1)  Sends a SIGHUP and SIGCONT to the foreground process group
(2)  Clears the tty from being controlling the session
(3)  Clears the controlling tty for all processes in the
session group.

The argument on_exit is set to 1 if called when a process is
exiting; it is 0 if called by the ioctl TIOCNOTTY.

Locking:
BTM is taken for hysterical raisons, and held when
called from \fBno_tty\fP.
tty_mutex is taken to protect tty
->siglock is taken to protect ->signal/->sighand
tasklist_lock is taken to walk process list for sessions
->siglock is taken to protect ->signal/->sighand
