.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "sock" 12
The socket on which to make the call
.IP "srx" 12
The address of the peer to contact
.IP "key" 12
The security context to use (defaults to socket setting)
.IP "user_call_ID" 12
The ID to use
.IP "tx_total_len" 12
Total length of data to transmit during the call (or -1)
.IP "gfp" 12
The allocation constraints
.IP "notify_rx" 12
Where to send notifications instead of socket queue
.IP "upgrade" 12
Request service upgrade for call
.IP "interruptibility" 12
The call is interruptible, or can be canceled.
.IP "debug_id" 12
The debug ID for tracing to be assigned to the call
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Allow a kernel service to begin a call on the nominated socket.  This just
sets up all the internal tracking structures and allocates connection and
call IDs as appropriate.  The call to be used is returned.

The default socket destination address and security may be overridden by
supplying \fIsrx\fP and \fIkey\fP.
