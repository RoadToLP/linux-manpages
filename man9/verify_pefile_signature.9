.SH NAME
verify_pefile_signature \- Verify the signature on a PE binary image
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" verify_pefile_signature
.BI "(const void *pebuf "  ","
.BI "unsigned pelen "  ","
.BI "struct key *trusted_keys "  ","
.BI "enum key_being_used_for usage "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "pebuf" 12
Buffer containing the PE binary image
.IP "pelen" 12
Length of the binary image
.IP "trusted_keys" 12
-- undescribed --
.IP "usage" 12
The use to which the key is being put.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Validate that the certificate chain inside the PKCS#7 message inside the PE
binary image intersects keys we already know and trust.

Returns, in order of descending priority:

(*) -ELIBBAD if the image cannot be parsed, or:

(*) -EKEYREJECTED if a signature failed to match for which we have a valid
key, or:

(*) 0 if at least one signature chain intersects with the keys in the trust
keyring, or:

(*) -ENODATA if there is no signature present.

(*) -ENOPKG if a suitable crypto module couldn't be found for a check on a
chain.

(*) -ENOKEY if we couldn't find a match for any of the signature chains in
the message.

May also return -ENOMEM.
