fwnode_graph_get_endpoint_by_id \- get endpoint by port and endpoint numbers
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "struct fwnode_handle *" fwnode_graph_get_endpoint_by_id
.BI "(const struct fwnode_handle *fwnode "  ","
.BI "u32 port "  ","
.BI "u32 endpoint "  ","

.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "fwnode" 12
parent fwnode_handle containing the graph
.IP "port" 12
identifier of the port node
.IP "endpoint" 12
identifier of the endpoint node under the port node
.IP "flags" 12
fwnode lookup flags
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Return the fwnode handle of the local endpoint corresponding the port and
endpoint IDs or NULL if not found.

If FWNODE_GRAPH_ENDPOINT_NEXT is passed in \fIflags\fP and the specified endpoint
has not been found, look for the closest endpoint ID greater than the
specified one and return the endpoint that corresponds to it, if present.

Do not return endpoints that belong to disabled devices, unless
FWNODE_GRAPH_DEVICE_DISABLED is passed in \fIflags\fP.

The returned endpoint needs to be released by calling \fBfwnode_handle_put\fP on
it when it is not needed any more.
