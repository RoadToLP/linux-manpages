.SH NAME
drm_rect_calc_hscale \- calculate the horizontal scaling factor
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" drm_rect_calc_hscale
.BI "(const struct drm_rect *src "  ","
.BI "const struct drm_rect *dst "  ","
.BI "int min_hscale "  ","
.BI "int max_hscale "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "src" 12
source window rectangle
.IP "dst" 12
destination window rectangle
.IP "min_hscale" 12
minimum allowed horizontal scaling factor
.IP "max_hscale" 12
maximum allowed horizontal scaling factor
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Calculate the horizontal scaling factor as
(\fIsrc\fP width) / (\fIdst\fP width).

If the scale is below 1 << 16, round down. If the scale is above
1 << 16, round up. This will calculate the scale with the most
pessimistic limit calculation.
.SH "RETURN"
The horizontal scaling factor, or errno of out of limits.
