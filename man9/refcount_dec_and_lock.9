.SH NAME
refcount_dec_and_lock \- return holding spinlock if able to decrement refcount to 0
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "bool" refcount_dec_and_lock
.BI "(refcount_t *r "  ","
.BI "spinlock_t *lock "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "r" 12
the refcount
.IP "lock" 12
the spinlock to be locked
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Similar to \fBatomic_dec_and_lock\fP, it will WARN on underflow and fail to
decrement when saturated at REFCOUNT_SATURATED.

Provides release memory ordering, such that prior loads and stores are done
before, and provides a control dependency such that \fBfree\fP must come after.
See the comment on top.
.SH "RETURN"
true and hold spinlock if able to decrement refcount to 0, false
otherwise
