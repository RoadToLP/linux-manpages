.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This is done in addition to CWV. The sender needs to have an idea of how many
packets may be in flight, to set the local Sequence Window value accordingly
(RFC 4340, 7.5.2). The CWV mechanism is exploited to keep track of the
maximum-used window. We use an EWMA low-pass filter to filter out noise.
