.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This is the hotplug event work handler (all ASICs).
The work gets scheduled from the IRQ handler if there
was a hotplug interrupt.  It walks through the connector table
and calls hotplug handler for each connector. After this, it sends
a DRM hotplug event to alert userspace.

This design approach is required in order to defer hotplug event handling
from the IRQ handler to a work handler because hotplug handler has to use
mutexes which cannot be locked in an IRQ handler (since \fImutex_lock\fP may
sleep).
