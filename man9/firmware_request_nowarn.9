.SH NAME

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" firmware_request_nowarn
.BI "(const struct firmware **firmware "  ","
.BI "const char *name "  ","
.BI "struct device *device "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "firmware" 12
pointer to firmware image
.IP "name" 12
name of firmware file

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function is similar in behaviour to \fBrequest_firmware\fP, except it
doesn't produce warning messages when the file is not found. The sysfs
fallback mechanism is enabled if direct filesystem lookup fails. However,
failures to find the firmware file with it are still suppressed. It is
therefore up to the driver to check for the return value of this call and to
decide when to inform the users of errors.
