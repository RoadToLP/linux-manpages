lpfc_issue_els_logo \- Issue a logo to an node on a vport
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" lpfc_issue_els_logo
.BI "(struct lpfc_vport *vport "  ","
.BI "struct lpfc_nodelist *ndlp "  ","
.BI "uint8_t retry "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "vport" 12
pointer to a virtual N_Port data structure.
.IP "ndlp" 12
pointer to a node-list data structure.
.IP "retry" 12
number of retries to the command IOCB.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This routine constructs and issues an ELS Logout (LOGO) iocb command
to a remote node, referred by an \fIndlp\fP on a \fIvport\fP. It constructs the
payload of the IOCB, properly sets up the \fIndlp\fP state, and invokes the
\fBlpfc_sli_issue_iocb\fP routine to send out the LOGO ELS command.

Note that, in \fBlpfc_prep_els_iocb\fP routine, the reference count of ndlp
will be incremented by 1 for holding the ndlp and the reference to ndlp
will be stored into the context1 field of the IOCB for the completion
callback function to the LOGO ELS command.

Callers of this routine are expected to unregister the RPI first

Return code
0 - successfully issued logo
1 - failed to issue logo
