.SH NAME
fscrypt_supported_policy \- check whether an encryption policy is supported
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "bool" fscrypt_supported_policy
.BI "(const union fscrypt_policy *policy_u "  ","
.BI "const struct inode *inode "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "policy_u" 12
the encryption policy
.IP "inode" 12
the inode on which the policy will be used
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Given an encryption policy, check whether all its encryption modes and other
settings are supported by this kernel on the given inode.  (But we don't
currently don't check for crypto API support here, so attempting to use an
algorithm not configured into the crypto API will still fail later.)
.SH "RETURN"
true if supported, else false
