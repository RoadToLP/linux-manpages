.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Find or create a superblock using the parameters stored in the filesystem
context and the two callback functions.

If an extant superblock is matched, then that will be returned with an
elevated reference count that the caller must transfer or discard.

If no match is made, a new superblock will be allocated and basic
initialisation will be performed (s_type, s_fs_info and s_id will be set and
the \fBset\fP callback will be invoked), the superblock will be published and it
will be returned in a partially constructed state with SB_BORN and SB_ACTIVE
as yet unset.
