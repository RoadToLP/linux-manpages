.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Return a set of flags that indicates display list completion status.

The VSP1_DL_FRAME_END_COMPLETED flag indicates that the previous display list
has completed at frame end. If the flag is not returned display list
completion has been delayed by one frame because the display list commit
raced with the frame end interrupt. The function always returns with the flag
set in single-shot mode as display list processing is then not continuous and
races never occur.

The following flags are only supported for continuous mode.

The VSP1_DL_FRAME_END_INTERNAL flag indicates that the display list that just
became active had been queued with the internal notification flag.

The VSP1_DL_FRAME_END_WRITEBACK flag indicates that the previously active
display list had been queued with the writeback flag.
