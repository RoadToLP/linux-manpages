.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Allow the hardware to automatically switch the clockdomain \fIclkdm\fP into
active or idle states, as needed by downstream clocks.  If the
clockdomain has any downstream clocks enabled in the clock
framework, wkdep/sleepdep autodependencies are added; this is so
device drivers can read and write to the device.  No return value.
