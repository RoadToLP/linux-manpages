SCSI cmd to examine.
.SH "NOTES"
This is *only* called when we are examining the status after sending
out the actual data command.  any commands that are queued for error
recovery (e.g. test_unit_ready) do *not* come through here.

When this routine returns failed, it means the error handler thread
is woken.  In cases where the error code indicates an error that
doesn't require the error handler read (i.e. we don't need to
abort/reset), this function should return SUCCESS.
