.SH NAME
ntfs_truncate \- called when the i_size of an ntfs inode is changed
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" ntfs_truncate
.BI "(struct inode *vi "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "vi" 12
inode for which the i_size was changed
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
We only support i_size changes for normal files at present, i.e. not
compressed and not encrypted.  This is enforced in \fBntfs_setattr\fP, see
below.

The kernel guarantees that \fIvi\fP is a regular file (\fBS_ISREG\fP is true) and
that the change is allowed.

This implies for us that \fIvi\fP is a file inode rather than a directory, index,
or attribute inode as well as that \fIvi\fP is a base inode.

Returns 0 on success or -errno on error.

Called with ->i_mutex held.
