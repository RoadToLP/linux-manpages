.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dev" 12
drm device
.IP "hdisplay" 12
hdisplay size
.IP "vdisplay" 12
vdisplay size
.IP "vrefresh" 12
vrefresh rate
.IP "reduced" 12
whether to use reduced blanking
.IP "interlaced" 12
whether to compute an interlaced mode
.IP "margins" 12
whether to add margins (borders)
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function is called to generate the modeline based on CVT algorithm
according to the hdisplay, vdisplay, vrefresh.
It is based from the VESA(TM) Coordinated Video Timing Generator by
Graham Loveridge April 9, 2003 available at
http://www.elo.utfsm.cl/~elo212/docs/CVTd6r1.xls 

And it is copied from xf86CVTmode in xserver/hw/xfree86/modes/xf86cvt.c.
What I have done is to translate it by using integer calculation.
.SH "RETURN"
The modeline based on the CVT algorithm stored in a drm_display_mode object.
The display mode object is allocated with \fBdrm_mode_create\fP. Returns NULL
when no mode could be allocated.
