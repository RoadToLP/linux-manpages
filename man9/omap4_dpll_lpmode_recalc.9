.SH NAME
omap4_dpll_lpmode_recalc \- compute DPLL low-power setting
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" omap4_dpll_lpmode_recalc
.BI "(struct dpll_data *dd "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dd" 12
pointer to the dpll data structure
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Calculates if low-power mode can be enabled based upon the last
multiplier and divider values calculated. If low-power mode can be
enabled, then the bit to enable low-power mode is stored in the
last_rounded_lpmode variable. This implementation is based upon the
criteria for enabling low-power mode as described in the OMAP4430/60
Public TRM section 3.6.3.3.2 "Enable Control, Status, and Low-Power
Operation Mode".
