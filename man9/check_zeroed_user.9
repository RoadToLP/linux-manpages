.SH NAME
check_zeroed_user \- check if a userspace buffer only contains zero bytes
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" check_zeroed_user
.BI "(const void __user *from "  ","
.BI "size_t size "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "from" 12
Source address, in userspace.
.IP "size" 12
Size of buffer.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This is effectively shorthand for "memchr_inv(from, 0, size) == NULL" for
userspace addresses (and is more efficient because we don't care where the
first non-zero byte is).
.SH "RETURN"
* 0: There were non-zero bytes present in the buffer.
* 1: The buffer was full of zero bytes.
* -EFAULT: access to userspace failed.
