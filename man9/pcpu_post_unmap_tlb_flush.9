.SH NAME
pcpu_post_unmap_tlb_flush \- flush TLB after unmapping
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" pcpu_post_unmap_tlb_flush
.BI "(struct pcpu_chunk *chunk "  ","
.BI "int page_start "  ","
.BI "int page_end "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "chunk" 12
pcpu_chunk the regions to be flushed belong to
.IP "page_start" 12
page index of the first page to be flushed
.IP "page_end" 12
page index of the last page to be flushed + 1
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Pages [\fIpage_start\fP,\fIpage_end\fP) of \fIchunk\fP have been unmapped.  Flush
TLB for the regions.  This can be skipped if the area is to be
returned to vmalloc as vmalloc will handle TLB flushing lazily.

As with \fBpcpu_pre_unmap_flush\fP, TLB flushing also is done at once
for the whole region.
