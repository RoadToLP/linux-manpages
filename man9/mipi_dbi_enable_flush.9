.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Flushes the whole framebuffer and enables the backlight. Drivers can use this
in their \fIdrm_simple_display_pipe_funcs->enable\fP callback.
.SH "NOTE"
Drivers which don't use \fBmipi_dbi_pipe_update\fP because they have custom
framebuffer flushing, can't use this function since they both use the same
flushing code.
