.SH ARGUMENTS

the QMI context
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
As a result of registering a name service with the QRTR all open sockets are
flagged with ENETRESET and this function will be called. The typical case is
the initial boot, where this signals that the local node id has been
configured and as such any bound sockets needs to be rebound. So close the
socket, inform the client and re-initialize the socket.

For clients it's generally sufficient to react to the del_server callbacks,
but server code is expected to treat the net_reset callback as a "bye" from
all nodes.

Finally the QMI handle will send out registration requests for any lookups
and services.
