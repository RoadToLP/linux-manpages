superblock to kill

\fBgeneric_shutdown_super\fP does all fs-independent work on superblock
shutdown.  Typical ->\fBkill_sb\fP should pick all fs-specific objects
that need destruction out of superblock, call \fBgeneric_shutdown_super\fP
and release aforementioned objects.  Note: dentries and inodes _are_
taken care of and do not need specific handling.

Upon calling this function, the filesystem may no longer alter or
rearrange the set of dentries belonging to this super_block, nor may it
change the attachments of dentries to inodes.
