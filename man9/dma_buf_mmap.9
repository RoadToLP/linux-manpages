.IP "pgoff" 12
[in]    offset in pages where this mmap should start within the
dma-buf buffer.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function adjusts the passed in vma so that it points at the file of the
dma_buf operation. It also adjusts the starting pgoff and does bounds
checking on the size of the vma. Then it calls the exporters mmap function to
set up the mapping.

Can return negative error values, returns 0 on success.
