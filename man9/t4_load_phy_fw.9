.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "adap" 12
the adapter
.IP "win" 12
the PCI-E Memory Window index to use for \fBt4_memory_rw\fP
.IP "phy_fw_version" 12
function to check PHY firmware versions
.IP "phy_fw_data" 12
the PHY firmware image to write
.IP "phy_fw_size" 12
image size

Transfer the specified PHY firmware to the adapter.  If a non-NULL
\fIphy_fw_version\fP is supplied, then it will be used to determine if
it's necessary to perform the transfer by comparing the version
of any existing adapter PHY firmware with that of the passed in
PHY firmware image.

A negative error number will be returned if an error occurs.  If
version number support is available and there's no need to upgrade
the firmware, 0 will be returned.  If firmware is successfully
transferred to the adapter, 1 will be returned.
.SH "NOTE"
some adapters only have local RAM to store the PHY firmware.  As
a result, a RESET of the adapter would cause that RAM to lose its
contents.  Thus, loading PHY firmware on such adapters must happen
after any FW_RESET_CMDs ...
