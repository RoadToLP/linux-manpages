.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Register a set of register updates to be applied to the device
whenever the device registers are synchronised with the cache and
apply them immediately.  Typically this is used to apply
corrections to be applied to the device defaults on startup, such
as the updates some vendors provide to undocumented registers.

The caller must ensure that this function cannot be called
concurrently with either itself or \fBregcache_sync\fP.
