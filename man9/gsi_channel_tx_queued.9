gsi_channel_tx_queued \- Report queued TX transfers for a channel
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" gsi_channel_tx_queued
.BI "(struct gsi_channel *channel "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "channel" 12
Channel for which to report
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Report to the network stack the number of bytes and transactions that
have been queued to hardware since last call.  This and the next function
supply information used by the network stack for throttling.

For each channel we track the number of transactions used and bytes of
data those transactions represent.  We also track what those values are
each time this function is called.  Subtracting the two tells us
the number of bytes and transactions that have been added between
successive calls.

Calling this each time we ring the channel doorbell allows us to
provide accurate information to the network stack about how much
work we've given the hardware at any point in time.
