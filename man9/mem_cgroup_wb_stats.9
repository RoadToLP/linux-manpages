.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "wb" 12
bdi_writeback in question
.IP "pfilepages" 12
out parameter for number of file pages
.IP "pheadroom" 12
out parameter for number of allocatable pages according to memcg
.IP "pdirty" 12
out parameter for number of dirty pages
.IP "pwriteback" 12
out parameter for number of pages under writeback
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Determine the numbers of file, headroom, dirty, and writeback pages in
\fIwb\fP's memcg.  File, dirty and writeback are self-explanatory.  Headroom
is a bit more involved.

A memcg's headroom is "min(max, high) - used".  In the hierarchy, the
headroom is calculated as the lowest headroom of itself and the
ancestors.  Note that this doesn't consider the actual amount of
available memory in the system.  The caller should further cap
*\fIpheadroom\fP accordingly.
