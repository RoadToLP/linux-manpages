.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Trace a synthetic event using the values passed in the variable
argument list.

The argument list should be a list 'n_vals' u64 values.  The number
of vals must match the number of field in the synthetic event, and
must be in the same order as the synthetic event fields.

All vals should be cast to u64, and string vals are just pointers
to strings, cast to u64.  Strings will be copied into space
reserved in the event for the string, using these pointers.
.SH "RETURN"
0 on success, err otherwise.
