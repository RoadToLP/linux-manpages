.SH NAME
kstrtoll \- convert a string to a long long
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" kstrtoll
.BI "(const char *s "  ","
.BI "unsigned int base "  ","
.BI "long long *res "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "s" 12
The start of the string. The string must be null-terminated, and may also
include a single newline before its terminating null. The first character
may also be a plus sign or a minus sign.
.IP "base" 12
The number base to use. The maximum supported base is 16. If base is
given as 0, then the base of the string is automatically detected with the
conventional semantics - If it begins with 0x the number will be parsed as a
hexadecimal (case insensitive), if it otherwise begins with 0, it will be
parsed as an octal number. Otherwise it will be parsed as a decimal.
.IP "res" 12
Where to write the result of the conversion on success.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Returns 0 on success, -ERANGE on overflow and -EINVAL on parsing error.
Preferred over \fBsimple_strtoll\fP. Return code must be checked.
