.SH NAME
__napi_alloc_skb \- allocate skbuff for rx in a specific NAPI instance
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "struct sk_buff *" __napi_alloc_skb
.BI "(struct napi_struct *napi "  ","
.BI "unsigned int len "  ","
.BI "gfp_t gfp_mask "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "napi" 12
napi instance this buffer was allocated for
.IP "len" 12
length to allocate
.IP "gfp_mask" 12
get_free_pages mask, passed to alloc_skb and alloc_pages

Allocate a new sk_buff for use in NAPI receive.  This buffer will
attempt to allocate the head from a special reserved region used
only for NAPI Rx allocation.  By doing this we can save several
CPU cycles by avoiding having to disable and re-enable IRQs.

NULL is returned if there is no free memory.
