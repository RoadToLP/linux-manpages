.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Register \fIcfts\fP to \fIss\fP.  Files described by \fIcfts\fP are created for all
existing cgroups to which \fIss\fP is attached and all future cgroups will
have them too.  This function can be called anytime whether \fIss\fP is
attached or not.

Returns 0 on successful registration, -errno on failure.  Note that this
function currently returns 0 as long as \fIcfts\fP registration is successful
even if some file creation attempts on existing cgroups fail.
