.SH NAME
drm_atomic_get_new_connector_for_encoder \- Get new connector for an encoder
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "struct drm_connector *" drm_atomic_get_new_connector_for_encoder
.BI "(struct drm_atomic_state *state "  ","
.BI "struct drm_encoder *encoder "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "state" 12
Atomic state
.IP "encoder" 12
The encoder to fetch the connector state for
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function finds and returns the connector that will be connected to
\fIencoder\fP as specified by the \fIstate\fP.

If there is no connector in \fIstate\fP which will have \fIencoder\fP connected to it,
this function will return NULL. While this may seem like an invalid use case,
it is sometimes useful to differentiate commits which have no connectors
attached to \fIencoder\fP vs ones that do (and to inspect their state). This is
especially true in disable hooks because the pipeline will change.
.SH "RETURN"
The new connector connected to \fIencoder\fP, or NULL if the encoder is
not connected.
