.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Once a FQDAN/CDAN has been produced, the corresponding FQ/channel is
considered "disarmed". Ie. the user can issue pull dequeue operations on that
traffic source for as long as it likes. Eventually it may wish to "rearm"
that source to allow it to produce another FQDAN/CDAN, that's what this
function achieves.

Return 0 for success.
