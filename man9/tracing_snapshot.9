.SH "DESCRIPTION"

This causes a swap between the snapshot buffer and the current live
tracing buffer. You can use this to take snapshots of the live
trace when some condition is triggered, but continue to trace.

Note, make sure to allocate the snapshot with either
a \fBtracing_snapshot_alloc\fP, or by doing it manually
with: echo 1 > /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/snapshot

If the snapshot buffer is not allocated, it will stop tracing.
Basically making a permanent snapshot.
