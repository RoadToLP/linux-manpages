.SH NAME
longrun_determine_freqs \- determines the lowest and highest possible core frequency
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" longrun_determine_freqs
.BI "(unsigned int *low_freq "  ","
.BI "unsigned int *high_freq "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "low_freq" 12
an int to put the lowest frequency into
.IP "high_freq" 12
an int to put the highest frequency into
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Determines the lowest and highest possible core frequencies on this CPU.
This is necessary to calculate the performance percentage according to
TMTA rules:
performance_pctg = (target_freq - low_freq)/(high_freq - low_freq)
