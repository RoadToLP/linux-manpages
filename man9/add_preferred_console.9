.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The last preferred console added will be used for kernel messages
and stdin/out/err for init.  Normally this is used by console_setup
above to handle user-supplied console arguments; however it can also
be used by arch-specific code either to override the user or more
commonly to provide a default console (ie from PROM variables) when
the user has not supplied one.
