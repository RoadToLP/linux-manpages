the timestamp of the beacon. 0 to reset the TSF. -1 to perform a
beacon timer update based on the current HW TSF.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Calculate the next target beacon transmit time (TBTT) based on the timestamp
of a received beacon or the current local hardware TSF and write it to the
beacon timer registers.

This is called in a variety of situations, e.g. when a beacon is received,
when a TSF update has been detected, but also when an new IBSS is created or
when we otherwise know we have to update the timers, but we keep it in this
function to have it all together in one place.
