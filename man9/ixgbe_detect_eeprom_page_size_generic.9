.SH NAME
ixgbe_detect_eeprom_page_size_generic \- Detect EEPROM page size
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "s32" ixgbe_detect_eeprom_page_size_generic
.BI "(struct ixgbe_hw *hw "  ","
.BI "u16 offset "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "hw" 12
pointer to hardware structure
.IP "offset" 12
offset within the EEPROM to be used as a scratch pad

Discover EEPROM page size by writing marching data at given offset.
This function is called only when we are writing a new large buffer
at given offset so the data would be overwritten anyway.
