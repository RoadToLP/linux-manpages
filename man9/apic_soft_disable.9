.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Contrary to \fBdisable_local_APIC\fP this does not touch the enable bit in
MSR_IA32_APICBASE. Clearing that bit on systems based on the 3 wire APIC
bus would require a hardware reset as the APIC would lose track of bus
arbitration. On systems with FSB delivery APICBASE could be disabled,
but it has to be guaranteed that no interrupt is sent to the APIC while
in that state and it's not clear from the SDM whether it still responds
to INIT/SIPI messages. Stay on the safe side and use software disable.
