.SH NAME
lpfc_io_error_detected_s3 \- Method for handling SLI-3 device PCI I/O error
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "pci_ers_result_t" lpfc_io_error_detected_s3
.BI "(struct pci_dev *pdev "  ","
.BI "pci_channel_state_t state "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "pdev" 12
pointer to PCI device.
.IP "state" 12
the current PCI connection state.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This routine is called from the PCI subsystem for I/O error handling to
device with SLI-3 interface spec. This function is called by the PCI
subsystem after a PCI bus error affecting this device has been detected.
When this function is invoked, it will need to stop all the I/Os and
interrupt(s) to the device. Once that is done, it will return
PCI_ERS_RESULT_NEED_RESET for the PCI subsystem to perform proper recovery
as desired.

Return codes
PCI_ERS_RESULT_CAN_RECOVER - can be recovered with reset_link
PCI_ERS_RESULT_NEED_RESET - need to reset before recovery
PCI_ERS_RESULT_DISCONNECT - device could not be recovered
