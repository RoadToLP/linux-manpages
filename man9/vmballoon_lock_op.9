Notify the host about page(s) that were ballooned (or removed from the
balloon) so that host can use it without fear that guest will need it (or
stop using them since the VM does). Host may reject some pages, we need to
check the return value and maybe submit a different page. The pages that are
inflated/deflated are pointed by \fIb->page\fP.
.SH "RETURN"
