.B "void" ei_rx_overrun
.BI "(struct net_device *dev "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dev" 12
network device which threw exception
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
We have a receiver overrun: we have to kick the 8390 to get it started
again. Problem is that you have to kick it exactly as NS prescribes in
the updated datasheets, or "the NIC may act in an unpredictable manner."
This includes causing "the NIC to defer indefinitely when it is stopped
on a busy network."  Ugh.
Called with lock held. Don't call this with the interrupts off or your
computer will hate you - it takes 10ms or so.
