.SH NAME
ntfs_attr_can_be_resident \- check if an attribute can be resident
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" ntfs_attr_can_be_resident
.BI "(const ntfs_volume *vol "  ","
.BI "const ATTR_TYPE type "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "vol" 12
ntfs volume to which the attribute belongs
.IP "type" 12
attribute type which to check
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Check whether the attribute of \fItype\fP on the ntfs volume \fIvol\fP is allowed to
be resident.  This information is derived from our ntfs knowledge and may
not be completely accurate, especially when user defined attributes are
present.  Basically we allow everything to be resident except for index
allocation and $EA attributes.

Return 0 if the attribute is allowed to be non-resident and -EPERM if not.

Warning: In the system file $MFT the attribute $Bitmap must be non-resident
otherwise windows will not boot (blue screen of death)!  We cannot
check for this here as we do not know which inode's $Bitmap is
being asked about so the caller needs to special case this.
