.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This routine tries to find some free common bufs in one of public pools with
Round Robin method. The search always starts from local hwqid, then the next
HWQ which was found last time (rrb_next_hwqid). Once a public pool is found,
a batch of free common bufs are moved to private pool on hwqid.
It might move less than count XRIs if there's not enough in public pool.
