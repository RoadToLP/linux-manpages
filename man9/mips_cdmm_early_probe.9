.SH NAME
mips_cdmm_early_probe \- Minimally probe for a specific device on CDMM.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void __iomem *" mips_cdmm_early_probe
.BI "(unsigned int dev_type "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dev_type" 12
CDMM type code to look for.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Minimally configure the in-CPU Common Device Memory Map (CDMM) and look for a
specific device. This can be used to find a device very early in boot for
example to configure an early FDC console device.

The caller must prevent migration to another CPU, either by disabling
pre-emption or by running from a pinned kernel thread.
.SH "RETURN"
MMIO pointer to device memory. The caller can read the ACSR
register to find more information about the device (such as the
version number or the number of blocks).
May return IOMEM_ERR_PTR(-errno) in case of error, so check with
\fBIS_ERR\fP.
