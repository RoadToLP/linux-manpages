.BI "(struct nand_chip *chip "  ","
.BI "struct gpio_desc *gpiod "  ","
.BI "unsigned long timeout_ms "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "chip" 12
NAND chip structure
.IP "gpiod" 12
GPIO descriptor of R/B pin
.IP "timeout_ms" 12
Timeout in ms
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Poll the R/B GPIO pin until it becomes ready. If that does not happen
whitin the specified timeout, -ETIMEDOUT is returned.

This helper is intended to be used when the controller has access to the
NAND R/B pin over GPIO.

Return 0 if the R/B pin indicates chip is ready, a negative error otherwise.
