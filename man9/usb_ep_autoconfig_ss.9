.SH NAME
usb_ep_autoconfig_ss \- choose an endpoint matching the ep descriptor and ep companion descriptor
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "struct usb_ep *" usb_ep_autoconfig_ss
.BI "(struct usb_gadget *gadget "  ","
.BI "struct usb_endpoint_descriptor *desc "  ","
.BI "struct usb_ss_ep_comp_descriptor *ep_comp "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gadget" 12
The device to which the endpoint must belong.
.IP "desc" 12
Endpoint descriptor, with endpoint direction and transfer mode
initialized.  For periodic transfers, the maximum packet
size must also be initialized.  This is modified on
success.
.IP "ep_comp" 12
Endpoint companion descriptor, with the required
number of streams. Will be modified when the chosen EP
supports a different number of streams.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This routine replaces the usb_ep_autoconfig when needed
superspeed enhancments. If such enhancemnets are required,
the FD should call usb_ep_autoconfig_ss directly and provide
the additional ep_comp parameter.

By choosing an endpoint to use with the specified descriptor,
this routine simplifies writing gadget drivers that work with
multiple USB device controllers.  The endpoint would be
passed later to \fBusb_ep_enable\fP, along with some descriptor.

That second descriptor won't always be the same as the first one.
For example, isochronous endpoints can be autoconfigured for high
bandwidth, and then used in several lower bandwidth altsettings.
Also, high and full speed descriptors will be different.

Be sure to examine and test the results of autoconfiguration
on your hardware.  This code may not make the best choices
about how to use the USB controller, and it can't know all
the restrictions that may apply. Some combinations of driver
and hardware won't be able to autoconfigure.

On success, this returns an claimed usb_ep, and modifies the endpoint
descriptor bEndpointAddress.  For bulk endpoints, the wMaxPacket value
is initialized as if the endpoint were used at full speed and
the bmAttribute field in the ep companion descriptor is
updated with the assigned number of streams if it is
different from the original value. To prevent the endpoint
from being returned by a later autoconfig call, claims it by
assigning ep->claimed to true.

On failure, this returns a null endpoint descriptor.
