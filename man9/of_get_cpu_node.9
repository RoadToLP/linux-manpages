.SH NAME
of_get_cpu_node \- Get device node associated with the given logical CPU
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "struct device_node *" of_get_cpu_node
.BI "(int cpu "  ","
.BI "unsigned int *thread "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "cpu" 12
CPU number(logical index) for which device node is required
.IP "thread" 12
if not NULL, local thread number within the physical core is
returned
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The main purpose of this function is to retrieve the device node for the
given logical CPU index. It should be used to initialize the of_node in
cpu device. Once of_node in cpu device is populated, all the further
references can use that instead.

CPU logical to physical index mapping is architecture specific and is built
before booting secondary cores. This function uses arch_match_cpu_phys_id
which can be overridden by architecture specific implementation.

Returns a node pointer for the logical cpu with refcount incremented, use
\fBof_node_put\fP on it when done. Returns NULL if not found.
