.SH NAME
sshp_parse_command \- Parse SSH command frame payload.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" sshp_parse_command
.BI "(const struct device *dev "  ","
.BI "const struct ssam_span *source "  ","
.BI "struct ssh_command **command "  ","
.BI "struct ssam_span *command_data "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dev" 12
The device used for logging.
.IP "source" 12
The source to parse from.
.IP "command" 12
The parsed command (output).
.IP "command_data" 12
The parsed command data/payload (output).
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Parses and validates a SSH command frame payload. Sets the \fIcommand\fP pointer
to the command header and the \fIcommand_data\fP span to the command data (i.e.
payload of the command). This will result in a zero-length span if the
command does not have any associated data/payload. This function does not
check the frame-payload-type field, which should be checked by the caller
before calling this function.

The \fIsource\fP parameter should be the complete frame payload, e.g. returned
by the \fBsshp_parse_frame\fP command.

This function does not copy any data, but rather only validates the frame
payload data and sets pointers (and length values) to indicate the
respective parts.
.SH "RETURN"
Returns zero on success or -ENOMSG if \fIsource\fP does not represent a
valid command-type frame payload, i.e. is too short.
