.SH NAME
calculate_min_delta \- Calculate a good minimum delta for mips_next_event().
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "unsigned int" calculate_min_delta
.BI "(void "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "void" 12
no arguments
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Running under virtualisation can introduce overhead into \fBmips_next_event\fP in
the form of hypervisor emulation of CP0_Count/CP0_Compare registers,
potentially with an unnatural frequency, which makes a fixed min_delta_ns
value inappropriate as it may be too small.

It can also introduce occasional latency from the guest being descheduled.

This function calculates a good minimum delta based roughly on the 75th
percentile of the time taken to do the \fBmips_next_event\fP sequence, in order
to handle potentially higher overhead while also eliminating outliers due to
unpredictable hypervisor latency (which can be handled by retries).
.SH "RETURN"
An appropriate minimum delta for the clock event device.
