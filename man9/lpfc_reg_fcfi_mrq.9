.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The REG_FCFI_MRQ mailbox command supports Fibre Channel Forwarders (FCFs).
The SLI Host uses the command to activate an FCF after it has acquired FCF
information via a READ_FCF mailbox command. This mailbox command also is used
to indicate where received unsolicited frames from this FCF will be sent. By
default this routine will set up the FCF to forward all unsolicited frames
the the RQ ID passed in the \fIphba\fP. This can be overridden by the caller for
more complicated setups.
