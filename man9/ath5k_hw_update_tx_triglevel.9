.SH NAME
ath5k_hw_update_tx_triglevel \- Update tx trigger level
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" ath5k_hw_update_tx_triglevel
.BI "(struct ath5k_hw *ah "  ","
.BI "bool increase "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "ah" 12
The \fIstruct ath5k_hw\fP
.IP "increase" 12
Flag to force increase of trigger level
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function increases/decreases the tx trigger level for the tx fifo
buffer (aka FIFO threshold) that is used to indicate when PCU flushes
the buffer and transmits its data. Lowering this results sending small
frames more quickly but can lead to tx underruns, raising it a lot can
result other problems. Right now we start with the lowest possible
(64Bytes) and if we get tx underrun we increase it using the increase
flag. Returns -EIO if we have reached maximum/minimum.

XXX: Link this with tx DMA size ?
XXX2: Use it to save interrupts ?
