.BI "(struct device *dev "  ","
.BI "u32 pasid "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dev" 12
target device
.IP "pasid" 12
pasid for draining
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Drain all pending page requests and responses related to \fIpasid\fP in both
software and hardware. This is supposed to be called after the device
driver has stopped DMA, the pasid entry has been cleared, and both IOTLB
and DevTLB have been invalidated.

It waits until all pending page requests for \fIpasid\fP in the page fault
queue are completed by the prq handling thread. Then follow the steps
described in VT-d spec CH7.10 to drain all page requests and page
responses pending in the hardware.
