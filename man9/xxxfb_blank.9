.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" xxxfb_blank

.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "blank_mode" 12
the blank mode we want. 
.IP "info" 12
frame buffer structure that represents a single frame buffer

Blank the screen if blank_mode != FB_BLANK_UNBLANK, else unblank.
Return 0 if blanking succeeded, != 0 if un-/blanking failed due to
e.g. a video mode which doesn't support it.

Implements VESA suspend and powerdown modes on hardware that supports
disabling hsync/vsync:

FB_BLANK_NORMAL = display is blanked, syncs are on.
FB_BLANK_HSYNC_SUSPEND = hsync off
FB_BLANK_VSYNC_SUSPEND = vsync off
FB_BLANK_POWERDOWN =  hsync and vsync off

If implementing this function, at least support FB_BLANK_UNBLANK.
Return !0 for any modes that are unimplemented.
