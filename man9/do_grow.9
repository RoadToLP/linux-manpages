.SH NAME
do_grow \- Touch and update inode size
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" do_grow
.BI "(struct inode *inode "  ","
.BI "u64 size "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "inode" 12
The inode
.IP "size" 12
The new size
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function updates the timestamps on the inode and
may also increase the size of the inode. This function
must not be called with \fIsize\fP any smaller than the current
inode size.

Although it is not strictly required to unstuff files here,
earlier versions of GFS2 have a bug in the stuffed file reading
code which will result in a buffer overrun if the size is larger
than the max stuffed file size. In order to prevent this from
occurring, such files are unstuffed, but in other cases we can
just update the inode size directly.
.SH "RETURN"
0 on success, or -ve on error
