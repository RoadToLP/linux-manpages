.SH NAME
ice_create_all_ctrlq \- main initialization routine for all control queues
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "enum ice_status" ice_create_all_ctrlq
.BI "(struct ice_hw *hw "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "hw" 12
pointer to the hardware structure
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Prior to calling this function, the driver *MUST* set the following fields
in the cq->structure for all control queues:
- cq->num_sq_entries
- cq->num_rq_entries
- cq->rq_buf_size
- cq->sq_buf_size

This function creates all the control queue locks and then calls
ice_init_all_ctrlq. It should be called once during driver load. If the
driver needs to re-initialize control queues at run time it should call
ice_init_all_ctrlq instead.
