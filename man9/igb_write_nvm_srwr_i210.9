.SH NAME
igb_write_nvm_srwr_i210 \- Write to Shadow RAM using EEWR
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "s32" igb_write_nvm_srwr_i210
.BI "(struct e1000_hw *hw "  ","
.BI "u16 offset "  ","
.BI "u16 words "  ","
.BI "u16 *data "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "hw" 12
pointer to the HW structure
.IP "offset" 12
offset within the Shadow RAM to be written to
.IP "words" 12
number of words to write
.IP "data" 12
16 bit word(s) to be written to the Shadow RAM

Writes data to Shadow RAM at offset using EEWR register.

If e1000_update_nvm_checksum is not called after this function , the
data will not be committed to FLASH and also Shadow RAM will most likely
contain an invalid checksum.

If error code is returned, data and Shadow RAM may be inconsistent - buffer
partially written.
