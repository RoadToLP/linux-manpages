intel_edp_drrs_flush \- Restart Idleness DRRS
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" intel_edp_drrs_flush
.BI "(struct drm_i915_private *dev_priv "  ","
.BI "unsigned int frontbuffer_bits "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dev_priv" 12
i915 device
.IP "frontbuffer_bits" 12
frontbuffer plane tracking bits
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function gets called every time rendering on the given planes has
completed or flip on a crtc is completed. So DRRS should be upclocked
(LOW_RR -> HIGH_RR). And also Idleness detection should be started again,
if no other planes are dirty.

Dirty frontbuffers relevant to DRRS are tracked in busy_frontbuffer_bits.
