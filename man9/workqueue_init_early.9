.SH "DESCRIPTION"

This is the first half of two-staged workqueue subsystem initialization
and invoked as soon as the bare basics - memory allocation, cpumasks and
idr are up.  It sets up all the data structures and system workqueues
and allows early boot code to create workqueues and queue/cancel work
items.  Actual work item execution starts only after kthreads can be
created and scheduled right before early initcalls.
