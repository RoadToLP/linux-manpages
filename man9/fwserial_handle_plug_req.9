fwserial_handle_plug_req \- handle VIRT_CABLE_PLUG request work
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" fwserial_handle_plug_req
.BI "(struct work_struct *work "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS

ptr to peer->work
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Attempts to complete the VIRT_CABLE_PLUG handshake sequence for this peer.

This checks for a collided request-- ie, that a VIRT_CABLE_PLUG request was
already sent to this peer. If so, the collision is resolved by comparing
guid values; the loser sends the plug response.
.SH "NOTE"
if an error prevents a response, don't do anything -- the
remote will timeout its request.
