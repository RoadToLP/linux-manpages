.SH NAME
lpfc_debugfs_lseek \- Seek through a debugfs file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "loff_t" lpfc_debugfs_lseek
.BI "(struct file *file "  ","
.BI "loff_t off "  ","
.BI "int whence "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "file" 12
The file pointer to seek through.
.IP "off" 12
The offset to seek to or the amount to seek by.
.IP "whence" 12
Indicates how to seek.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This routine is the entry point for the debugfs lseek file operation. The
\fIwhence\fP parameter indicates whether \fIoff\fP is the offset to directly seek to,
or if it is a value to seek forward or reverse by. This function figures out
what the new offset of the debugfs file will be and assigns that value to the
f_pos field of \fIfile\fP.
.SH "RETURN"
This function returns the new offset if successful and returns a negative
error if unable to process the seek.
