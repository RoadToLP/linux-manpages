.SH NAME
pci_pm_reset \- Put device into PCI_D3 and back into PCI_D0.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" pci_pm_reset
.BI "(struct pci_dev *dev "  ","
.BI "int probe "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dev" 12
Device to reset.
.IP "probe" 12
If set, only check if the device can be reset this way.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
If \fIdev\fP supports native PCI PM and its PCI_PM_CTRL_NO_SOFT_RESET flag is
unset, it will be reinitialized internally when going from PCI_D3hot to
PCI_D0.  If that's the case and the device is not in a low-power state
already, force it into PCI_D3hot and back to PCI_D0, causing it to be reset.
.SH "NOTE"
This causes the caller to sleep for twice the device power transition
cooldown period, which for the D0->D3hot and D3hot->D0 transitions is 10 ms
by default (i.e. unless the \fIdev\fP's d3hot_delay field has a different value).
Moreover, only devices in D0 can be reset by this function.
