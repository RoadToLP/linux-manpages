.BI "unsigned long size "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "mgr" 12
Manager object
.IP "page_offset" 12
Offset of available memory area (page-based)
.IP "size" 12
Size of available address space range (page-based)
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Initialize a new offset-manager. The offset and area size available for the
manager are given as \fIpage_offset\fP and \fIsize\fP. Both are interpreted as
page-numbers, not bytes.

Adding/removing nodes from the manager is locked internally and protected
against concurrent access. However, node allocation and destruction is left
for the caller. While calling into the vma-manager, a given node must
always be guaranteed to be referenced.
