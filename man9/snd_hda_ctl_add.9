.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "codec" 12
HD-audio codec
.IP "nid" 12
corresponding NID (optional)
.IP "kctl" 12
the control element to assign
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Add the given control element to an array inside the codec instance.
All control elements belonging to a codec are supposed to be added
by this function so that a proper clean-up works at the free or
reconfiguration time.

If non-zero \fInid\fP is passed, the NID is assigned to the control element.
The assignment is shown in the codec proc file.

\fBsnd_hda_ctl_add\fP checks the control subdev id field whether
#HDA_SUBDEV_NID_FLAG bit is set.  If set (and \fInid\fP is zero), the lower
bits value is taken as the NID to assign. The #HDA_NID_ITEM_AMP bit
specifies if kctl->private_value is a HDA amplifier value.
