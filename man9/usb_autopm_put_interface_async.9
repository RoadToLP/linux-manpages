.SH NAME
usb_autopm_put_interface_async \- decrement a USB interface's PM-usage counter
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" usb_autopm_put_interface_async
.BI "(struct usb_interface *intf "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "intf" 12
the usb_interface whose counter should be decremented
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This routine does much the same thing as \fBusb_autopm_put_interface\fP:
It decrements \fIintf\fP's usage counter and schedules a delayed
autosuspend request if the counter is <= 0.  The difference is that it
does not perform any synchronization; callers should hold a private
lock and handle all synchronization issues themselves.

Typically a driver would call this routine during an URB's completion
handler, if no more URBs were pending.

This routine can run in atomic context.
