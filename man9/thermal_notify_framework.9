.IP "tz" 12
thermal zone device

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function handles the trip events from sensor drivers. It starts
throttling the cooling devices according to the policy configured.
For CRITICAL and HOT trip points, this notifies the respective drivers,
and does actual throttling for other trip points i.e ACTIVE and PASSIVE.
The throttling policy is based on the configured platform data; if no
platform data is provided, this uses the step_wise throttling policy.
