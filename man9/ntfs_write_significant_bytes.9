.SH NAME
ntfs_write_significant_bytes \- write the significant bytes of a number
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" ntfs_write_significant_bytes
.BI "(s8 *dst "  ","
.BI "const s8 *dst_max "  ","
.BI "const s64 n "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dst" 12
destination buffer to write to
.IP "dst_max" 12
pointer to last byte of destination buffer for bounds checking
.IP "n" 12
number whose significant bytes to write
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Store in \fIdst\fP, the minimum bytes of the number \fIn\fP which are required to
identify \fIn\fP unambiguously as a signed number, taking care not to exceed
\fIdest_max\fP, the maximum position within \fIdst\fP to which we are allowed to
write.

This is used when building the mapping pairs array of a runlist to compress
a given logical cluster number (lcn) or a specific run length to the minimum
size possible.

Return the number of bytes written on success.  On error, i.e. the
destination buffer \fIdst\fP is too small, return -ENOSPC.
