.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function is registered to the SPI framework for this SPI master
controller. If it is the first time when setup is called by this device,
this function will initialize the runtime state for this chip and save
the same in the device structure. Else it will update the runtime info
with the updated chip info. Nothing is really being written to the
controller hardware here, that is not done until the actual transfer
commence.
