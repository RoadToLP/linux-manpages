.SH NAME
throtl_pop_queued \- pop the first bio form a qnode list
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "struct bio *" throtl_pop_queued
.BI "(struct list_head *queued "  ","
.BI "struct throtl_grp **tg_to_put "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "queued" 12
the qnode list to pop a bio from
.IP "tg_to_put" 12
optional out argument for throtl_grp to put
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Pop the first bio from the qnode list \fIqueued\fP.  After popping, the first
qnode is removed from \fIqueued\fP if empty or moved to the end of \fIqueued\fP so
that the popping order is round-robin.

When the first qnode is removed, its associated throtl_grp should be put
too.  If \fItg_to_put\fP is NULL, this function automatically puts it;
otherwise, *\fItg_to_put\fP is set to the throtl_grp to put and the caller is
responsible for putting it.
