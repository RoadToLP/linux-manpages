.SH NAME
notifier_call_chain_robust \- Inform the registered notifiers about an event and rollback on error.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" notifier_call_chain_robust
.BI "(struct notifier_block **nl "  ","
.BI "unsigned long val_up "  ","
.BI "unsigned long val_down "  ","
.BI "void *v "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "nl" 12
Pointer to head of the blocking notifier chain
.IP "val_up" 12
Value passed unmodified to the notifier function
.IP "val_down" 12
Value passed unmodified to the notifier function when recovering
from an error on \fIval_up\fP
\fIv\fP           Pointer passed unmodified to the notifier function
.IP "v" 12
-- undescribed --
.SH "NOTE"
It is important the \fInl\fP chain doesn't change between the two
invocations of \fBnotifier_call_chain\fP such that we visit the
exact same notifier callbacks; this rules out any RCU usage.
.SH "RETURN"
the return value of the \fIval_up\fP call.
