.SH NAME
sas_find_bcast_dev \- find the device issue BROADCAST(CHANGE).
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" sas_find_bcast_dev
.BI "(struct domain_device *dev "  ","
.BI "struct domain_device **src_dev "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dev" 12
domain device to be detect.
.IP "src_dev" 12
the device which originated BROADCAST(CHANGE).
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Add self-configuration expander support. Suppose two expander cascading,
when the first level expander is self-configuring, hotplug the disks in
second level expander, BROADCAST(CHANGE) will not only be originated
in the second level expander, but also be originated in the first level
expander (see SAS protocol SAS 2r-14, 7.11 for detail), it is to say,
expander changed count in two level expanders will all increment at least
once, but the phy which chang count has changed is the source device which
we concerned.
