.SH NAME
omap4_vc_i2c_timing_init \- sets up board I2C timing parameters
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" omap4_vc_i2c_timing_init
.BI "(struct voltagedomain *voltdm "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "voltdm" 12
voltagedomain pointer to get data from
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Use PMIC + board supplied settings for calculating the total I2C
channel capacitance and set the timing parameters based on this.
Pre-calculated values are provided in data tables, as it is not
too straightforward to calculate these runtime.
