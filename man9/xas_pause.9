.SH NAME
xas_pause \- Pause a walk to drop a lock.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" xas_pause
.BI "(struct xa_state *xas "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "xas" 12
XArray operation state.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Some users need to pause a walk and drop the lock they're holding in
order to yield to a higher priority thread or carry out an operation
on an entry.  Those users should call this function before they drop
the lock.  It resets the \fIxas\fP to be suitable for the next iteration
of the loop after the user has reacquired the lock.  If most entries
found during a walk require you to call \fBxas_pause\fP, the \fBxa_for_each\fP
iterator may be more appropriate.

Note that \fBxas_pause\fP only works for forward iteration.  If a user needs
to pause a reverse iteration, we will need a \fBxas_pause_rev\fP.
