.SH NAME
__i40e_reprogram_flex_pit \- Re-program specific FLX_PIT table
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" __i40e_reprogram_flex_pit
.BI "(struct i40e_pf *pf "  ","
.BI "struct list_head *flex_pit_list "  ","
.BI "int flex_pit_start "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "pf" 12
Pointer to the PF structure
.IP "flex_pit_list" 12
list of flexible src offsets in use
.IP "flex_pit_start" 12
index to first entry for this section of the table
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
In order to handle flexible data, the hardware uses a table of values
called the FLX_PIT table. This table is used to indicate which sections of
the input correspond to what PIT index values. Unfortunately, hardware is
very restrictive about programming this table. Entries must be ordered by
src_offset in ascending order, without duplicates. Additionally, unused
entries must be set to the unused index value, and must have valid size and
length according to the src_offset ordering.

This function will reprogram the FLX_PIT register from a book-keeping
structure that we guarantee is already ordered correctly, and has no more
than 3 entries.

To make things easier, we only support flexible values of one word length,
rather than allowing variable length flexible values.
