.SH "DESCRIPTION"

This function implements a test that checks that the conversion of perf time
to and from TSC is consistent with the order of events.  If the test passes
0 is returned, otherwise -1 is returned.  If TSC conversion is not
supported then then the test passes but " (not supported)" is printed.
