.SH NAME
e1000_k1_workaround_lpt_lp \- K1 workaround on Lynxpoint-LP
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "s32" e1000_k1_workaround_lpt_lp
.BI "(struct e1000_hw *hw "  ","
.BI "bool link "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "hw" 12
pointer to the HW structure
.IP "link" 12
link up bool flag

When K1 is enabled for 1Gbps, the MAC can miss 2 DMA completion indications
preventing further DMA write requests.  Workaround the issue by disabling
the de-assertion of the clock request when in 1Gpbs mode.
Also, set appropriate Tx re-transmission timeouts for 10 and 100Half link
speeds in order to avoid Tx hangs.
