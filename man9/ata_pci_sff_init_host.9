.SH NAME
ata_pci_sff_init_host \- acquire native PCI ATA resources and init host
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" ata_pci_sff_init_host
.BI "(struct ata_host *host "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "host" 12
target ATA host

Acquire native PCI ATA resources for \fIhost\fP and initialize the
first two ports of \fIhost\fP accordingly.  Ports marked dummy are
skipped and allocation failure makes the port dummy.

Note that native PCI resources are valid even for legacy hosts
as we fix up pdev resources array early in boot, so this
function can be used for both native and legacy SFF hosts.

LOCKING:
Inherited from calling layer (may sleep).
.SH "RETURN"
0 if at least one port is initialized, -ENODEV if no port is
available.
