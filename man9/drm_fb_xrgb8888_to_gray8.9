.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Drm doesn't have native monochrome or grayscale support.
Such drivers can announce the commonly supported XR24 format to userspace
and use this function to convert to the native format.

Monochrome drivers will use the most significant bit,
where 1 means foreground color and 0 background color.

ITU BT.601 is used for the RGB -> luma (brightness) conversion.
