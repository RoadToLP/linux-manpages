rdtgroup_pseudo_lock_create \- Create a pseudo-locked region
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" rdtgroup_pseudo_lock_create
.BI "(struct rdtgroup *rdtgrp "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "rdtgrp" 12
resource group to which pseudo-lock region belongs
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Called when a resource group in the pseudo-locksetup mode receives a
valid schemata that should be pseudo-locked. Since the resource group is
in pseudo-locksetup mode the \fIstruct pseudo_lock_region\fP has already been
allocated and initialized with the essential information. If a failure
occurs the resource group remains in the pseudo-locksetup mode with the
\fIstruct pseudo_lock_region\fP associated with it, but cleared from all
information and ready for the user to re-attempt pseudo-locking by
writing the schemata again.
.SH "RETURN"
0 if the pseudo-locked region was successfully pseudo-locked, <0
on failure. Descriptive error will be written to last_cmd_status buffer.
