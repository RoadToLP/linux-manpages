rcu_nmi_enter \- inform RCU of entry to NMI context
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "noinstr void" rcu_nmi_enter
.BI "(void "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS

.SH "DESCRIPTION"

If the CPU was idle from RCU's viewpoint, update rdp->dynticks and
rdp->dynticks_nmi_nesting to let the RCU grace-period handling know
that the CPU is active.  This implementation permits nested NMIs, as
long as the nesting level does not overflow an int.  (You will probably
run out of stack space first.)

If you add or remove a call to \fBrcu_nmi_enter\fP, be sure to test
with CONFIG_RCU_EQS_DEBUG=y.
