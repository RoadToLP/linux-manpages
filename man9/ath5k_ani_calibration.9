.SH "DESCRIPTION"
We count OFDM and CCK errors relative to the time where we did not send or
receive ("listen" time) and raise or lower immunity accordingly.
This is called regularly (every second) from the calibration timer, but also
when an error threshold has been reached.

In order to synchronize access from different contexts, this should be
called only indirectly by scheduling the ANI tasklet!
