.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "adap" 12
the adapter
.IP "mbox" 12
mailbox to use for the FW command
.IP "viid" 12
the VI id
.IP "free" 12
if true any existing filters for this VI id are first removed
.IP "naddr" 12
the number of MAC addresses to allocate filters for (up to 7)
.IP "addr" 12
the MAC address(es)
.IP "idx" 12
where to store the index of each allocated filter
.IP "hash" 12
pointer to hash address filter bitmap
.IP "sleep_ok" 12
call is allowed to sleep

Allocates an exact-match filter for each of the supplied addresses and
sets it to the corresponding address.  If \fIidx\fP is not NULL it should
have at least \fInaddr\fP entries, each of which will be set to the index of
the filter allocated for the corresponding MAC address.  If a filter
could not be allocated for an address its index is set to 0xffff.
If \fIhash\fP is not NULL addresses that fail to allocate an exact filter
are hashed and update the hash filter bitmap pointed at by \fIhash\fP.

Returns a negative error number or the number of filters allocated.
