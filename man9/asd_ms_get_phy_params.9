.SH NAME
asd_ms_get_phy_params \- get phy parameters from the manufacturing sector
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" asd_ms_get_phy_params
.BI "(struct asd_ha_struct *asd_ha "  ","
.BI "struct asd_manuf_sec *manuf_sec "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "asd_ha" 12
pointer to the host adapter structure
.IP "manuf_sec" 12
pointer to the manufacturing sector
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The manufacturing sector contans also the linked list of sub-segments,
since when it was read, its size was taken from the flash directory,
not from the structure size.

HIDDEN phys do not count in the total count.  REPORTED phys cannot
be enabled but are reported and counted towards the total.
ENABLED phys are enabled by default and count towards the total.
The absolute total phy number is ASD_MAX_PHYS.  hw_prof->num_phys
merely specifies the number of phys the host adapter decided to
report.  E.g., it is possible for phys 0, 1 and 2 to be HIDDEN,
phys 3, 4 and 5 to be REPORTED and phys 6 and 7 to be ENABLED.
In this case ASD_MAX_PHYS is 8, hw_prof->num_phys is 5, and only 2
are actually enabled (enabled by default, max number of phys
enableable in this case).
