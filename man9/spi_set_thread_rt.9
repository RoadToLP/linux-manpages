controller to boost priority of
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This can be called because the controller requested realtime priority
(by setting the ->rt value before calling \fBspi_register_controller\fP) or
because a device on the bus said that its transfers needed realtime
priority.
.SH "NOTE"
at the moment if any device on a bus says it needs realtime then
the thread will be at realtime priority for all transfers on that
controller.  If this eventually becomes a problem we may see if we can
find a way to boost the priority only temporarily during relevant
transfers.
