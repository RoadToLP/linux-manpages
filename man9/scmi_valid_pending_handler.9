.SH NAME
scmi_valid_pending_handler \- Helper to check pending status of handlers
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" scmi_valid_pending_handler
.BI "(struct scmi_notify_instance *ni "  ","
.BI "struct scmi_event_handler *hndl "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "ni" 12
A reference to the notification instance to use
.IP "hndl" 12
The event handler to check
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
An handler is considered pending when its r_evt == NULL, because the related
event was still unknown at handler's registration time; anyway, since all
protocols register their supported events once for all at protocols'
initialization time, a pending handler cannot be considered valid anymore if
the underlying event (which it is waiting for), belongs to an already
initialized and registered protocol.
.SH "RETURN"
0 on Success
