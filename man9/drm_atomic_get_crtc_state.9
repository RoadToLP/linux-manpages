drm_atomic_get_crtc_state \- get CRTC state
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "struct drm_crtc_state *" drm_atomic_get_crtc_state
.BI "(struct drm_atomic_state *state "  ","
.BI "struct drm_crtc *crtc "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "state" 12
global atomic state object
.IP "crtc" 12
CRTC to get state object for
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function returns the CRTC state for the given CRTC, allocating it if
needed. It will also grab the relevant CRTC lock to make sure that the state
is consistent.

WARNING: Drivers may only add new CRTC states to a \fIstate\fP if
drm_atomic_state.allow_modeset is set, or if it's a driver-internal commit
not created by userspace through an IOCTL call.

Either the allocated state or the error code encoded into the pointer. When
the error is EDEADLK then the w/w mutex code has detected a deadlock and the
entire atomic sequence must be restarted. All other errors are fatal.
.SH "RETURN"
