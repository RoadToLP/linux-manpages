.SH NAME
ice_conv_link_speed_to_virtchnl \- 
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "u32" ice_conv_link_speed_to_virtchnl
.BI "(bool adv_link_support "  ","
.BI "u16 link_speed "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "adv_link_support" 12
determines the format of the returned link speed
.IP "link_speed" 12
variable containing the link_speed to be converted
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Convert link speed supported by HW to link speed supported by virtchnl.
If adv_link_support is true, then return link speed in Mbps. Else return
link speed as a VIRTCHNL_LINK_SPEED_* casted to a u32. Note that the caller
needs to cast back to an enum virtchnl_link_speed in the case where
adv_link_support is false, but when adv_link_support is true the caller can
expect the speed in Mbps.
