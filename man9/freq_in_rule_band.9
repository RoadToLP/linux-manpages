.SH NAME
freq_in_rule_band \- tells us if a frequency is in a frequency band
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "bool" freq_in_rule_band
.BI "(const struct ieee80211_freq_range *freq_range "  ","
.BI "u32 freq_khz "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "freq_range" 12
frequency rule we want to query
.IP "freq_khz" 12
frequency we are inquiring about
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This lets us know if a specific frequency rule is or is not relevant to
a specific frequency's band. Bands are device specific and artificial
definitions (the "2.4 GHz band", the "5 GHz band" and the "60GHz band"),
however it is safe for now to assume that a frequency rule should not be
part of a frequency's band if the start freq or end freq are off by more
than 2 GHz for the 2.4 and 5 GHz bands, and by more than 20 GHz for the
60 GHz band.
This resolution can be lowered and should be considered as we add
regulatory rule support for other "bands".
