.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This is essentially the same as asd_post_ascb_list, but we do not
increment pending, add those to the pending list or get indexes.
See \fBasd_init_escbs\fP and \fBasd_init_post_escbs\fP.

Since sending a list of ascbs is a superset of sending a single
ascb, this function exists to generalize this.  More specifically,
when sending a list of those, we want to do only a _single_
\fBmemcpy\fP at swap head, as opposed to for each ascb sent (in the
case of sending them one by one).  That is, we want to minimize the
ratio of \fBmemcpy\fP operations to the number of ascbs sent.  The same
logic applies to \fBasd_post_ascb_list\fP.
