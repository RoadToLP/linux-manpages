.SH "DESCRIPTION"

This function is called after either CPU or memory configuration has
changed and updates cpuset accordingly.  The top_cpuset is always
synchronized to cpu_active_mask and N_MEMORY, which is necessary in
order to make cpusets transparent (of no affect) on systems that are
actively using CPU hotplug but making no active use of cpusets.

Non-root cpusets are only affected by offlining.  If any CPUs or memory
nodes have been taken down, \fBcpuset_hotplug_update_tasks\fP is invoked on
all descendants.

Note that CPU offlining during suspend is ignored.  We don't modify
cpusets across suspend/resume cycles at all.
