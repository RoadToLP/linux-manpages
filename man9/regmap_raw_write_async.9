.SH NAME
regmap_raw_write_async \- Write raw values to one or more registers asynchronously
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" regmap_raw_write_async
.BI "(struct regmap *map "  ","
.BI "unsigned int reg "  ","
.BI "const void *val "  ","
.BI "size_t val_len "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "map" 12
Register map to write to
.IP "reg" 12
Initial register to write to
.IP "val" 12
Block of data to be written, laid out for direct transmission to the
device.  Must be valid until \fBregmap_async_complete\fP is called.
.IP "val_len" 12
Length of data pointed to by val.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function is intended to be used for things like firmware
download where a large block of data needs to be transferred to the
device.  No formatting will be done on the data provided.

If supported by the underlying bus the write will be scheduled
asynchronously, helping maximise I/O speed on higher speed buses
like SPI.  \fBregmap_async_complete\fP can be called to ensure that all
asynchrnous writes have been completed.

A value of zero will be returned on success, a negative errno will
be returned in error cases.
