.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Initialize device before it's used by a driver. Ask low-level code
to enable I/O and memory. Wake up the device if it was suspended.
Beware, this function can fail.

Note we don't actually enable the device many times if we call
this function repeatedly (we just increment the count).
