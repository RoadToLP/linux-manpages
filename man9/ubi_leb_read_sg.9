.SH NAME
ubi_leb_read_sg \- read data into a scatter gather list.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" ubi_leb_read_sg
.BI "(struct ubi_volume_desc *desc "  ","
.BI "int lnum "  ","
.BI "struct ubi_sgl *sgl "  ","
.BI "int offset "  ","
.BI "int len "  ","
.BI "int check "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "desc" 12
volume descriptor
.IP "lnum" 12
logical eraseblock number to read from
.IP "sgl" 12
UBI scatter gather list to store the read data
.IP "offset" 12
offset within the logical eraseblock to read from
.IP "len" 12
how many bytes to read
.IP "check" 12
whether UBI has to check the read data's CRC or not.

This function works exactly like \fBubi_leb_read_sg\fP. But instead of
storing the read data into a buffer it writes to an UBI scatter gather
list.
