.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function adds information about a used physical eraseblock to the
'used' tree of the corresponding volume. The function is rather complex
because it has to handle cases when this is not the first physical
eraseblock belonging to the same logical eraseblock, and the newer one has
to be picked, while the older one has to be dropped. This function returns
zero in case of success and a negative error code in case of failure.
