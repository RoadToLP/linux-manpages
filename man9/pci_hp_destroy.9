pointer to the \fIstruct hotplug_slot\fP to destroy
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Destroy a PCI slot used by a hotplug driver.  Once this has been called,
the driver may no longer invoke \fBhotplug_slot_name\fP to get the slot's
unique name.  The driver no longer needs to handle a ->reset_slot callback
from this point on.

Returns 0 on success or a negative int on error.
