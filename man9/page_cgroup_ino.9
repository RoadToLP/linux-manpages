.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Look up the closest online ancestor of the memory cgroup \fIpage\fP is charged to
and return its inode number or 0 if \fIpage\fP is not charged to any cgroup. It
is safe to call this function without holding a reference to \fIpage\fP.

Note, this function is inherently racy, because there is nothing to prevent
the cgroup inode from getting torn down and potentially reallocated a moment
after \fBpage_cgroup_ino\fP returns, so it only should be used by callers that
do not care (such as procfs interfaces).
