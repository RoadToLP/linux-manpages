.SH NAME
device_links_busy \- Check if there are any busy links to consumers.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "bool" device_links_busy
.BI "(struct device *dev "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dev" 12
Device to check.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Check each consumer of the device and return 'true' if its link's status
is one of "consumer probe" or "active" (meaning that the given consumer is
probing right now or its driver is present).  Otherwise, change the link
state to "supplier unbind" to prevent the consumer from being probed
successfully going forward.

Return 'false' if there are no probing or active consumers.

Links without the DL_FLAG_MANAGED flag set are ignored.
