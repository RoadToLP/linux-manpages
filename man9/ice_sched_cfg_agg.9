.SH "DESCRIPTION"
It registers a unique aggregator node into scheduler services. It
allows a user to register with a unique ID to track it's resources.
The aggregator type determines if this is a queue group, VSI group
or aggregator group. It then creates the aggregator node(s) for requested
TC(s) or removes an existing aggregator node including its configuration
if indicated via tc_bitmap. Call ice_rm_agg_cfg to release aggregator
resources and remove aggregator ID.
This function needs to be called with scheduler lock held.
