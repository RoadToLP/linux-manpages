.SH NAME
acpi_device_get_power \- Get power state of an ACPI device.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" acpi_device_get_power
.BI "(struct acpi_device *device "  ","
.BI "int *state "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "device" 12
Device to get the power state of.
.IP "state" 12
Place to store the power state of the device.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function does not update the device's power.state field, but it may
update its parent's power.state field (when the parent's power state is
unknown and the device's power state turns out to be D0).

Also, it does not update power resource reference counters to ensure that
the power state returned by it will be persistent and it may return a power
state shallower than previously set by \fBacpi_device_set_power\fP for \fIdevice\fP
(if that power state depends on any power resources).
