.SH NAME
merge_system_ram_resource \- mark the System RAM resource mergeable and try to merge it with adjacent, mergeable resources
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" merge_system_ram_resource
.BI "(struct resource *res "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "res" 12
resource descriptor
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This interface is intended for memory hotplug, whereby lots of contiguous
system ram resources are added (e.g., via add_memory*()) by a driver, and
the actual resource boundaries are not of interest (e.g., it might be
relevant for DIMMs). Only resources that are marked mergeable, that have the
same parent, and that don't have any children are considered. All mergeable
resources must be immutable during the request.
.SH "NOTE"
- The caller has to make sure that no pointers to resources that are
marked mergeable are used anymore after this call - the resource might
be freed and the pointer might be stale!
- \fBrelease_mem_region_adjustable\fP will split on demand on memory hotunplug
