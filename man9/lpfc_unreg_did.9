.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The unregister DID mailbox command is used to unregister an N_Port/F_Port
login for an unknown RPI by specifying the DID of a remote port. This
command frees an RPI context in the HBA port. This has the effect of
performing an implicit N_Port/F_Port logout.

This routine prepares the mailbox command for unregistering a remote
N_Port/F_Port (DID) login.
