.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Set the zoned model of the request queue of \fIdisk\fP according to \fImodel\fP.
When \fImodel\fP is BLK_ZONED_HM (host managed), this should be called only
if zoned block device support is enabled (CONFIG_BLK_DEV_ZONED option).
If \fImodel\fP specifies BLK_ZONED_HA (host aware), the effective model used
depends on CONFIG_BLK_DEV_ZONED settings and on the existence of partitions
on the disk.
