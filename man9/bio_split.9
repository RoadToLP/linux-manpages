.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Allocates and returns a new bio which represents \fIsectors\fP from the start of
\fIbio\fP, and updates \fIbio\fP to represent the remaining sectors.

Unless this is a discard request the newly allocated bio will point
to \fIbio\fP's bi_io_vec. It is the caller's responsibility to ensure that
neither \fIbio\fP nor \fIbs\fP are freed before the split bio.
