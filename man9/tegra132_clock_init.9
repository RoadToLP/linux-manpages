.SH NAME
tegra132_clock_init \- Tegra132-specific clock initialization
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" tegra132_clock_init
.BI "(struct device_node *np "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "np" 12
struct device_node * of the DT node for the SoC CAR IP block
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Register most SoC clocks for the Tegra132 system-on-chip.  Most of
this code is shared between the Tegra124 and Tegra132 SoCs,
although some of the initial clock settings and CPU clocks differ.
Intended to be called by the OF init code when a DT node with the
"nvidia,tegra132-car" string is encountered, and declared with
CLK_OF_DECLARE.  No return value.
