.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" i40e_get_stats_count
.BI "(struct net_device *netdev "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "netdev" 12
the netdev to return the count for
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Returns the total number of statistics for this netdev. Note that even
though this is a function, it is required that the count for a specific
netdev must never change. Basing the count on static values such as the
maximum number of queues or the device type is ok. However, the API for
obtaining stats is *not* safe against changes based on non-static
values such as the *current* number of queues, or runtime flags.

If a statistic is not always enabled, return it as part of the count
anyways, always return its string, and report its value as zero.
