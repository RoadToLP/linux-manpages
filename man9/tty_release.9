Takes bkl. See tty_release_dev
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Even releasing the tty structures is a tricky business.. We have
to be very careful that the structures are all released at the
same time, as interrupts might otherwise get the wrong pointers.

WSH 09/09/97: rewritten to avoid some nasty race conditions that could
lead to double frees or releasing memory still in use.
