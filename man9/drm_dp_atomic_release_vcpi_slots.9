drm_dp_atomic_release_vcpi_slots \- Release allocated vcpi slots
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" drm_dp_atomic_release_vcpi_slots
.BI "(struct drm_atomic_state *state "  ","
.BI "struct drm_dp_mst_topology_mgr *mgr "  ","
.BI "struct drm_dp_mst_port *port "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "state" 12
global atomic state
.IP "mgr" 12
MST topology manager for the port
.IP "port" 12
The port to release the VCPI slots from
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Releases any VCPI slots that have been allocated to a port in the atomic
state. Any atomic drivers which support MST must call this function in
their \fIdrm_connector_helper_funcs\fP.\fBatomic_check\fP callback when the
connector will no longer have VCPI allocated (e.g. because its CRTC was
removed) when it had VCPI allocated in the previous atomic state.

It is OK to call this even if \fIport\fP has been removed from the system.
Additionally, it is OK to call this function multiple times on the same
\fIport\fP as needed. It is not OK however, to call this function and
\fBdrm_dp_atomic_find_vcpi_slots\fP on the same \fIport\fP in a single atomic check
phase.

.SH "RETURN"
0 if all slots for this port were added back to
\fIdrm_dp_mst_topology_state.avail_slots\fP or negative error code
