.SH NAME
drm_self_refresh_helper_alter_state \- Alters the atomic state for SR exit
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" drm_self_refresh_helper_alter_state
.BI "(struct drm_atomic_state *state "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "state" 12
the state currently being checked
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Called at the end of atomic check. This function checks the state for flags
incompatible with self refresh exit and changes them. This is a bit
disingenuous since userspace is expecting one thing and we're giving it
another. However in order to keep self refresh entirely hidden from
userspace, this is required.

At the end, we queue up the self refresh entry work so we can enter PSR after
the desired delay.
