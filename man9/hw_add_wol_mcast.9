.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This routine is used to add multicast pattern for waking up the host.

It is assumed the multicast packet is the ICMPv6 neighbor solicitation used
by IPv6 ping command.  Note that multicast packets are filtred through the
multicast hash table, so not all multicast packets can wake up the host.
