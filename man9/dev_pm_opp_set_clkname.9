.SH NAME
dev_pm_opp_set_clkname \- Set clk name for the device
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "struct opp_table *" dev_pm_opp_set_clkname
.BI "(struct device *dev "  ","
.BI "const char *name "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dev" 12

.IP "name" 12
Clk name.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
In order to support OPP switching, OPP layer needs to get pointer to the
clock for the device. Simple cases work fine without using this routine (i.e.
by passing connection-id as NULL), but for a device with multiple clocks
available, the OPP core needs to know the exact name of the clk to use.

This must be called before any OPPs are initialized for the device.
