NAND chip object
.IP "buf" 12
temporary buffer
.IP "td" 12

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Read the bad block table by searching for a given ident pattern. Search is
preformed either from the beginning up or from the end of the device
downwards. The search starts always at the start of a block. If the option
NAND_BBT_PERCHIP is given, each chip is searched for a bbt, which contains
the bad block information of this chip. This is necessary to provide support
for certain DOC devices.

The bbt ident pattern resides in the oob area of the first page in a block.
