.SH "DESCRIPTION"

This is the latter half of two-staged workqueue subsystem initialization
and invoked as soon as kthreads can be created and scheduled.
Workqueues have been created and work items queued on them, but there
are no kworkers executing the work items yet.  Populate the worker pools
with the initial workers and enable future kworker creations.
