.SH NAME
__genwqe_purge_ddcb \- Remove a DDCB from the workqueue
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" __genwqe_purge_ddcb
.BI "(struct genwqe_dev *cd "  ","
.BI "struct ddcb_requ *req "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "cd" 12
genwqe device descriptor
.IP "req" 12
DDCB request
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This will fail when the request was already FETCHED. In this case
we need to wait until it is finished. Else the DDCB can be
reused. This function also ensures that the request data structure
is removed from ddcb_req[].

Do not forget to call this function when \fBgenwqe_wait_ddcb\fP fails,
such that the request gets really removed from ddcb_req[].
.SH "RETURN"
0 success
