.SH NAME
gfs2_allocate_page_backing \- Allocate blocks for a write fault
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" gfs2_allocate_page_backing
.BI "(struct page *page "  ","
.BI "unsigned int length "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "page" 12
The (locked) page to allocate backing for
.IP "length" 12
Size of the allocation
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
We try to allocate all the blocks required for the page in one go.  This
might fail for various reasons, so we keep trying until all the blocks to
back this page are allocated.  If some of the blocks are already allocated,
that is ok too.
