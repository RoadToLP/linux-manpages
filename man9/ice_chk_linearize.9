.SH NAME
ice_chk_linearize \- Check if there are more than 8 fragments per packet
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "bool" ice_chk_linearize
.BI "(struct sk_buff *skb "  ","
.BI "unsigned int count "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "skb" 12
send buffer
.IP "count" 12
number of buffers used
.SH "NOTE"
Our HW can't scatter-gather more than 8 fragments to build
a packet on the wire and so we need to figure out the cases where we
need to linearize the skb.
