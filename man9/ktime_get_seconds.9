.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Returns the seconds portion of CLOCK_MONOTONIC with a single non
serialized read. tk->ktime_sec is of type 'unsigned long' so this
works on both 32 and 64 bit systems. On 32 bit systems the readout
covers ~136 years of uptime which should be enough to prevent
premature wrap arounds.
