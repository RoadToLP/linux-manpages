.SH NAME
omac1_aes_128_vector \- One-Key CBC MAC (OMAC1) hash with AES-128
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" omac1_aes_128_vector
.BI "(u8 *key "  ","
.BI "size_t num_elem "  ","
.BI "u8 *addr[] "  ","
.BI "size_t *len "  ","

.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "key" 12
128-bit key for the hash operation
.IP "num_elem" 12
Number of elements in the data vector
.IP "addr" 12
Pointers to the data areas
.IP "len" 12
Lengths of the data blocks
.IP "mac" 12
Buffer for MAC (128 bits, i.e., 16 bytes)
.SH "RETURN"
0 on success, -1 on failure
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This is a mode for using block cipher (AES in this case) for authentication.
OMAC1 was standardized with the name CMAC by NIST in a Special Publication
