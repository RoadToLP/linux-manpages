.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Once FREEZING is initiated, transition to FROZEN is lazily updated by
calling this function.  If the current state is FREEZING but not FROZEN,
this function checks whether all tasks of this cgroup and the descendant
cgroups finished freezing and, if so, sets FROZEN.

The caller is responsible for grabbing RCU read lock and calling
\fBupdate_if_frozen\fP on all descendants prior to invoking this function.

Task states and freezer state might disagree while tasks are being
migrated into or out of \fIcss\fP, so we can't verify task states against
\fIfreezer\fP state here.  See \fBfreezer_attach\fP for details.
