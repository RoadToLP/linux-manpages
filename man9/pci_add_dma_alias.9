.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This helper encodes an 8-bit devfn as a bit number in dma_alias_mask
which is used to program permissible bus-devfn source addresses for DMA
requests in an IOMMU.  These aliases factor into IOMMU group creation
and are useful for devices generating DMA requests beyond or different
from their logical bus-devfn.  Examples include device quirks where the
device simply uses the wrong devfn, as well as non-transparent bridges
where the alias may be a proxy for devices in another domain.

IOMMU group creation is performed during device discovery or addition,
prior to any potential DMA mapping and therefore prior to driver probing
(especially for userspace assigned devices where IOMMU group definition
cannot be left as a userspace activity).  DMA aliases should therefore
be configured via quirks, such as the PCI fixup header quirk.
