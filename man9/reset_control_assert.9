.SH NAME
reset_control_assert \- asserts the reset line
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" reset_control_assert
.BI "(struct reset_control *rstc "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "rstc" 12
reset controller
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Calling this on an exclusive reset controller guarantees that the reset
will be asserted. When called on a shared reset controller the line may
still be deasserted, as long as other users keep it so.

For shared reset controls a driver cannot expect the hw's registers and
internal state to be reset, but must be prepared for this to happen.
Consumers must not use reset_control_reset on shared reset lines when
reset_control_(de)assert has been used.

If rstc is NULL it is an optional reset and the function will just
return 0.
