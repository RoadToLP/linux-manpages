.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This routine probes for tuners at the expected I2C addresses. On most
cases, if a device answers to a given I2C address, it assumes that the
device is a tuner. On a few cases, however, an additional logic is needed
to double check if the device is really a tuner, or to identify the tuner
type, like on tea5767/5761 devices.

During client attach, set_type is called by adapter's attach_inform callback.
set_type must then be completed by tuner_probe.
