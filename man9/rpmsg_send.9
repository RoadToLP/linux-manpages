.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function sends \fIdata\fP of length \fIlen\fP on the \fIept\fP endpoint.
The message will be sent to the remote processor which the \fIept\fP
endpoint belongs to, using \fIept\fP's address and its associated rpmsg
device destination addresses.
In case there are no TX buffers available, the function will block until
one becomes available, or a timeout of 15 seconds elapses. When the latter
happens, -ERESTARTSYS is returned.

Can only be called from process context (for now).

Returns 0 on success and an appropriate error value on failure.
