.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Mark existing routes matching those specified in the passed array
as being weak, meaning that they are ignored for the purpose of
power decisions.  The main intended use case is for sidetone paths
which couple audio between other independent paths if they are both
active in order to make the combination work better at the user
level but which aren't intended to be "used".

Note that CODEC drivers should not use this as sidetone type paths
can frequently also be used as bypass paths.
