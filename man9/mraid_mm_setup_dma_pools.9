.SH "DESCRIPTION"
We maintain a pool of dma buffers per each adapter. Each pool has one
buffer. E.g, we may have 5 dma pools - one each for 4k, 8k ... 64k buffers.
We have just one 4k buffer in 4k pool, one 8k buffer in 8k pool etc. We
dont' want to waste too much memory by allocating more buffers per each
pool.
