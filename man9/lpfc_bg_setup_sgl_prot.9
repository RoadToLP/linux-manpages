.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "phba" 12
The Hba for which this call is being executed.
.IP "sc" 12
pointer to scsi command we're working on
.IP "sgl" 12
pointer to buffer list for protection groups
.IP "datacnt" 12
number of segments of data that have been dma mapped
.IP "protcnt" 12
number of segment of protection data that have been dma mapped
.IP "lpfc_cmd" 12
lpfc scsi command object pointer.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function sets up SGL buffer list for protection groups of
type LPFC_PG_TYPE_DIF

This is usually used when DIFs are in their own buffers,
separate from the data. The HBA can then by instructed
to place the DIFs in the outgoing stream.  For read operations,
The HBA could extract the DIFs and place it in DIF buffers.

The buffer list for this type consists of one or more of the
protection groups described below:
+-------------------------+
start of first prot group  -->   |         DISEED          |
+-------------------------+
|      DIF (Prot SGE)     |
+-------------------------+
|        Data SGE         |
+-------------------------+
|more Data SGE's ... (opt)|
+-------------------------+
start of new  prot group  -->    |         DISEED          |
+-------------------------+
|          ...            |
+-------------------------+

Returns the number of SGEs added to the SGL.
.SH "NOTE"
It is assumed that both data and protection s/g buffers have been
mapped for DMA
