.SH NAME
regulator_set_voltage_time_sel \- get raise/fall time
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" regulator_set_voltage_time_sel
.BI "(struct regulator_dev *rdev "  ","
.BI "unsigned int old_selector "  ","
.BI "unsigned int new_selector "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "rdev" 12
regulator source device
.IP "old_selector" 12
selector for starting voltage
.IP "new_selector" 12
selector for target voltage
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Provided with the starting and target voltage selectors, this function
returns time in microseconds required to rise or fall to this new voltage

Drivers providing ramp_delay in regulation_constraints can use this as their
\fBset_voltage_time_sel\fP operation.
