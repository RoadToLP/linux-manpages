the adapter

Can be invoked from interrupt context e.g.  error handler.

Note that this function cannot disable the restart of tasklets as
it cannot wait if called from interrupt context, however the
tasklets will have no effect since the doorbells are disabled. The
driver will call \fBtg3_sge_stop\fP later from process context, at
which time the tasklets will be stopped if they are still running.
