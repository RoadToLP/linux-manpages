.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This handler is invoked when the IRQ line asserts to find out what happened.
As we cannot allow ourselves to sleep in HARDIRQ context, this handler runs
in thread context.

Read the interrupt status, work out what needs to be done and then clear
any of the interrupts that are not needed.
