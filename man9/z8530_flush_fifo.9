Channel to flush

Flush the receive FIFO. There is no specific option for this, we 
blindly read bytes and discard them. Reading when there is no data
is harmless. The 8530 has a 4 byte FIFO, the 85230 has 8 bytes.

All locking is handled for the caller. On return data may still be
present if it arrived during the flush.
