.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The function parses the \fIfilter\fP string and creates an array containing
the list of z/VM user ID filter entries.
Return code 0 means success, -EINVAL if the filter is syntactically
incorrect, -ENOMEM if there was not enough memory to allocate the
filter list array, or -ENOSPC if too many z/VM user IDs have been specified.
