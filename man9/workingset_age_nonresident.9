.SH NAME
workingset_age_nonresident \- age non-resident entries as LRU ages
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" workingset_age_nonresident
.BI "(struct lruvec *lruvec "  ","
.BI "unsigned long nr_pages "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "lruvec" 12
the lruvec that was aged
.IP "nr_pages" 12
the number of pages to count
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
As in-memory pages are aged, non-resident pages need to be aged as
well, in order for the refault distances later on to be comparable
to the in-memory dimensions. This function allows reclaim and LRU
operations to drive the non-resident aging along in parallel.
