.SH "DESCRIPTION"
See above notes about why we can't use multi-BD RX queues except in
rare cases (mass storage class), and can never use the hardware "rndis"
mode (since it's not a "true" RNDIS mode) with complete safety..

It's ESSENTIAL that callers specify "onepacket" mode unless they kick in
code to recover from corrupted datastreams after each short transfer.
