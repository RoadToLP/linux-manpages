.SH NAME
has_valid_asid \- Determine if an mm already has an ASID.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" has_valid_asid
.BI "(const struct mm_struct *mm "  ","
.BI "unsigned int type "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "mm" 12
Memory map.
.IP "type" 12
R4K_HIT or R4K_INDEX, type of cache op.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Determines whether \fImm\fP already has an ASID on any of the CPUs which cache ops
of type \fItype\fP within an \fBr4k_on_each_cpu\fP call will affect. If
\fBr4k_on_each_cpu\fP does an SMP call to a single VPE in each core, then the
scope of the operation is confined to sibling CPUs, otherwise all online CPUs
will need to be checked.

Must be called in non-preemptive context.
.SH "RETURN"
1 if the CPUs affected by \fItype\fP cache ops have an ASID for \fImm\fP.
0 otherwise.
