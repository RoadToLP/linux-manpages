.SH NAME
dma_fence_wait_timeout \- sleep until the fence gets signaled or until timeout elapses
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "signed long" dma_fence_wait_timeout
.BI "(struct dma_fence *fence "  ","
.BI "bool intr "  ","
.BI "signed long timeout "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "fence" 12
the fence to wait on
.IP "intr" 12
if true, do an interruptible wait
.IP "timeout" 12
timeout value in jiffies, or MAX_SCHEDULE_TIMEOUT
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Returns -ERESTARTSYS if interrupted, 0 if the wait timed out, or the
remaining timeout in jiffies on success. Other error values may be
returned on custom implementations.

Performs a synchronous wait on this fence. It is assumed the caller
directly or indirectly (buf-mgr between reservation and committing)
holds a reference to the fence, otherwise the fence might be
freed before return, resulting in undefined behavior.
