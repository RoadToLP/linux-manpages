.SH NAME
devm_clk_hw_register_clkdev \- managed clk lookup registration for clk_hw
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" devm_clk_hw_register_clkdev
.BI "(struct device *dev "  ","
.BI "struct clk_hw *hw "  ","
.BI "const char *con_id "  ","
.BI "const char *dev_id "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dev" 12
device this lookup is bound
.IP "hw" 12
struct clk_hw to associate with all clk_lookups
.IP "con_id" 12
connection ID string on device
.IP "dev_id" 12
format string describing device name
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
con_id or dev_id may be NULL as a wildcard, just as in the rest of
clkdev.

To make things easier for mass registration, we detect error clk_hws
from a previous clk_hw_register_*() call, and return the error code for
those.  This is to permit this function to be called immediately
after clk_hw_register_*().
