.SH NAME
snd_fw_schedule_registration \- schedule work for sound card registration
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" snd_fw_schedule_registration
.BI "(struct fw_unit *unit "  ","
.BI "struct delayed_work *dwork "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "unit" 12
an instance for unit on IEEE 1394 bus
.IP "dwork" 12
delayed work with callback function
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function is not designed for general purposes. When new unit is
connected to IEEE 1394 bus, the bus is under bus-reset state because of
topological change. In this state, units tend to fail both of asynchronous
and isochronous communication. To avoid this problem, this function is used
to postpone sound card registration after the state. The callers must
set up instance of delayed work in advance.
