.SH NAME
vmw_fence_obj_lookup \- Look up a user-space fence object
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "struct ttm_base_object *" vmw_fence_obj_lookup
.BI "(struct ttm_object_file *tfile "  ","
.BI "u32 handle "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "tfile" 12
A struct ttm_object_file identifying the caller.
.IP "handle" 12
A handle identifying the fence object.
.SH "RETURN"
A struct vmw_user_fence base ttm object on success or
an error pointer on failure.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The fence object is looked up and type-checked. The caller needs
to have opened the fence object first, but since that happens on
creation and fence objects aren't shareable, that's not an
issue currently.
