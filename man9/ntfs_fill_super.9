.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" ntfs_fill_super
.BI "(struct super_block *sb "  ","
.BI "void *opt "  ","
.BI "const int silent "  ");"

.IP "sb" 12
super block of ntfs filesystem to mount
.IP "opt" 12
string containing the mount options
.IP "silent" 12
silence error output
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBntfs_fill_super\fP is called by the VFS to mount the device described by \fIsb\fP
with the mount otions in \fIdata\fP with the NTFS filesystem.

If \fIsilent\fP is true, remain silent even if errors are detected. This is used
during bootup, when the kernel tries to mount the root filesystem with all
registered filesystems one after the other until one succeeds. This implies
that all filesystems except the correct one will quite correctly and
expectedly return an error, but nobody wants to see error messages when in
fact this is what is supposed to happen.
.SH "NOTE"
\fIsb->s_flags\fP contains the mount options flags.
