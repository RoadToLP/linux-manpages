.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" zpool_destroy_pool
.BI "(struct zpool *zpool "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "zpool" 12
The zpool to destroy.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Implementations must guarantee this to be thread-safe,
however only when destroying different pools.  The same
pool should only be destroyed once, and should not be used
after it is destroyed.

This destroys an existing zpool.  The zpool should not be in use.
