.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function checks if the property \fIprop_name\fP that is present in the
\fIcon_np\fP device tree node is one of the known common device tree bindings
that list phandles to suppliers. If \fIprop_name\fP isn't one, this function
doesn't do anything.

If \fIprop_name\fP is one, this function attempts to create fwnode links from the
consumer device tree node \fIcon_np\fP to all the suppliers device tree nodes
listed in \fIprop_name\fP.

Any failed attempt to create a fwnode link will NOT result in an immediate
return.  \fBof_link_property\fP must create links to all the available supplier
device tree nodes even when attempts to create a link to one or more
suppliers fail.
