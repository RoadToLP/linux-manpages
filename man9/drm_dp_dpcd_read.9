.SH NAME
drm_dp_dpcd_read \- read a series of bytes from the DPCD
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "ssize_t" drm_dp_dpcd_read
.BI "(struct drm_dp_aux *aux "  ","
.BI "unsigned int offset "  ","
.BI "void *buffer "  ","
.BI "size_t size "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "aux" 12
DisplayPort AUX channel (SST or MST)
.IP "offset" 12
address of the (first) register to read
.IP "buffer" 12
buffer to store the register values
.IP "size" 12
number of bytes in \fIbuffer\fP
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Returns the number of bytes transferred on success, or a negative error
code on failure. -EIO is returned if the request was NAKed by the sink or
if the retry count was exceeded. If not all bytes were transferred, this
function returns -EPROTO. Errors from the underlying AUX channel transfer
function, with the exception of -EBUSY (which causes the transaction to
be retried), are propagated to the caller.
