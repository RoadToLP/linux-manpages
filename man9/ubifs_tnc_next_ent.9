.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function finds and reads the next directory or extended attribute entry
after the given key (\fIkey\fP) if there is one. \fInm\fP is used to resolve
collisions.

If the name of the current entry is not known and only the key is known,
\fInm->name\fP has to be NULL. In this case the semantics of this function is a
little bit different and it returns the entry corresponding to this key, not
the next one. If the key was not found, the closest "right" entry is
returned.

If the fist entry has to be found, \fIkey\fP has to contain the lowest possible
key value for this inode and \fIname\fP has to be NULL.

This function returns the found directory or extended attribute entry node
in case of success, -ENOENT is returned if no entry was found, and a
negative error code is returned in case of failure.
