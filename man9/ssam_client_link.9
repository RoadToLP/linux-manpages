.SH NAME
ssam_client_link \- Link an arbitrary client device to the controller.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" ssam_client_link
.BI "(struct ssam_controller *c "  ","
.BI "struct device *client "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "c" 12
The controller to link to.
.IP "client" 12
The client device.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Link an arbitrary client device to the controller by creating a device link
between it as consumer and the controller device as provider. This function
can be used for non-SSAM devices (or SSAM devices not registered as child
under the controller) to guarantee that the controller is valid for as long
as the driver of the client device is bound, and that proper suspend and
resume ordering is guaranteed.

The device link does not have to be destructed manually. It is removed
automatically once the driver of the client device unbinds.
.SH "RETURN"
Returns zero on success, -ENODEV if the controller is not ready or
going to be removed soon, or -ENOMEM if the device link could not be
created for other reasons.
