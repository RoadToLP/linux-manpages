.SH NAME
report_iommu_fault \- report about an IOMMU fault to the IOMMU framework
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" report_iommu_fault
.BI "(struct iommu_domain *domain "  ","
.BI "struct device *dev "  ","
.BI "unsigned long iova "  ","
.BI "int flags "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "domain" 12
the iommu domain where the fault has happened
.IP "dev" 12
the device where the fault has happened
.IP "iova" 12
the faulting address
.IP "flags" 12
mmu fault flags (e.g. IOMMU_FAULT_READ/IOMMU_FAULT_WRITE/...)
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function should be called by the low-level IOMMU implementations
whenever IOMMU faults happen, to allow high-level users, that are
interested in such events, to know about them.

This event may be useful for several possible use cases:
- mere logging of the event
- dynamic TLB/PTE loading
- if restarting of the faulting device is required

Returns 0 on success and an appropriate error code otherwise (if dynamic
PTE/TLB loading will one day be supported, implementations will be able
to tell whether it succeeded or not according to this return value).

Specifically, -ENOSYS is returned if a fault handler isn't installed
(though fault handlers can also return -ENOSYS, in case they want to
elicit the default behavior of the IOMMU drivers).
