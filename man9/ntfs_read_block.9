.SH NAME
ntfs_read_block \- fill a @page of an address space with data
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" ntfs_read_block
.BI "(struct page *page "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "page" 12
page cache page to fill with data
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Fill the page \fIpage\fP of the address space belonging to the \fIpage->host\fP inode.
We read each buffer asynchronously and when all buffers are read in, our io
completion handler \fBntfs_end_buffer_read_async\fP, if required, automatically
applies the mst fixups to the page before finally marking it uptodate and
unlocking it.

We only enforce allocated_size limit because i_size is checked for in
\fBgeneric_file_read\fP.

Return 0 on success and -errno on error.

Contains an adapted version of fs/buffer.c::\fBblock_read_full_page\fP.
