.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" ccp_enqueue_cmd
.BI "(struct ccp_cmd *cmd "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "cmd" 12
ccp_cmd struct to be processed
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Queue a cmd to be processed by the CCP. If queueing the cmd
would exceed the defined length of the cmd queue the cmd will
only be queued if the CCP_CMD_MAY_BACKLOG flag is set and will
result in a return code of -EBUSY.

The callback routine specified in the ccp_cmd struct will be
called to notify the caller of completion (if the cmd was not
backlogged) or advancement out of the backlog. If the cmd has
advanced out of the backlog the "err" value of the callback
will be -EINPROGRESS. Any other "err" value during callback is
the result of the operation.

The cmd has been successfully queued if:
the return code is -EINPROGRESS or
the return code is -EBUSY and CCP_CMD_MAY_BACKLOG flag is set
