.SH NAME
devm_drm_panel_bridge_add_typed \- Creates a managed &drm_bridge and &drm_connector with an explicit connector type.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "struct drm_bridge *" devm_drm_panel_bridge_add_typed
.BI "(struct device *dev "  ","
.BI "struct drm_panel *panel "  ","
.BI "u32 connector_type "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dev" 12
device to tie the bridge lifetime to
.IP "panel" 12
The drm_panel being wrapped.  Must be non-NULL.
.IP "connector_type" 12
The connector type (DRM_MODE_CONNECTOR_*)
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This is just like \fBdevm_drm_panel_bridge_add\fP, but forces the connector type
to \fIconnector_type\fP instead of infering it from the panel.

This function is deprecated and should not be used in new drivers. Use
\fBdevm_drm_panel_bridge_add\fP instead, and fix panel drivers as necessary if
they don't report a connector type.
