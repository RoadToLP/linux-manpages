.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Our usual strategy is to defer writing revokes as much as we can in the hope
that we'll eventually overwrite the journal, which will make those revokes
go away.  This changes when we flush the log: at that point, there will
likely be some left-over space in the last revoke block of that transaction.
We can fill that space with additional revokes for blocks that have already
been written back.  This will basically come at no cost now, and will save
us from having to keep track of those blocks on the AIL2 list later.
