.SH NAME
usb_hub_clear_tt_buffer \- clear control/bulk TT state in high speed hub
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" usb_hub_clear_tt_buffer
.BI "(struct urb *urb "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "urb" 12
an URB associated with the failed or incomplete split transaction
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
High speed HCDs use this to tell the hub driver that some split control or
bulk transaction failed in a way that requires clearing internal state of
a transaction translator.  This is normally detected (and reported) from
interrupt context.

It may not be possible for that hub to handle additional full (or low)
speed transactions until that state is fully cleared out.
.SH "RETURN"
0 if successful. A negative error code otherwise.
