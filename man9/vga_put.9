.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This fuction releases resources previously locked by \fBvga_get\fP or
\fBvga_tryget\fP. The resources aren't disabled right away, so that a subsequence
\fBvga_get\fP on the same card will succeed immediately. Resources have a
counter, so locks are only released if the counter reaches 0.
