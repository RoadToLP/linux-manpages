.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This API uses no smu->mutex lock protection due to:
1. It is either called by other IP block(gfx/sdma/vcn/uvd/vce).
This is guarded to be race condition free by the caller.
2. Or get called on user setting request of power_dpm_force_performance_level.
Under this case, the smu->mutex lock protection is already enforced on
the parent API smu_force_performance_level of the call path.
