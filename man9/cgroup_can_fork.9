.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This prepares a new css_set for the child process which the child will
be attached to in \fBcgroup_post_fork\fP.
This calls the subsystem \fBcan_fork\fP callbacks. If the \fBcgroup_can_fork\fP
callback returns an error, the fork aborts with that error code. This
allows for a cgroup subsystem to conditionally allow or deny new forks.
