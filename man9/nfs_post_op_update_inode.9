.SH NAME
nfs_post_op_update_inode \- try to update the inode attribute cache
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" nfs_post_op_update_inode
.BI "(struct inode *inode "  ","
.BI "struct nfs_fattr *fattr "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "inode" 12
pointer to inode
.IP "fattr" 12
updated attributes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
After an operation that has changed the inode metadata, mark the
attribute cache as being invalid, then try to update it.

NB: if the server didn't return any post op attributes, this
function will force the retrieval of attributes before the next
NFS request.  Thus it should be used only for operations that
are expected to change one or more attributes, to avoid
unnecessary NFS requests and trips through \fBnfs_update_inode\fP.
