.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function looks at the proposed state for CRTCs and planes, then chooses
which pipe is going to have FBC by setting intel_crtc_state->enable_fbc to
true.

Later, intel_fbc_enable is going to look for state->enable_fbc and then maybe
enable FBC for the chosen CRTC. If it does, it will set dev_priv->fbc.crtc.
