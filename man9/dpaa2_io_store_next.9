.SH NAME
dpaa2_io_store_next \- Determine when the next dequeue result is available.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "struct dpaa2_dq *" dpaa2_io_store_next
.BI "(struct dpaa2_io_store *s "  ","
.BI "int *is_last "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "s" 12
the dpaa2_io_store object.
.IP "is_last" 12
indicate whether this is the last frame in the pull command.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
When an object driver performs dequeues to a dpaa2_io_store, this function
can be used to determine when the next frame result is available. Once
this function returns non-NULL, a subsequent call to it will try to find
the next dequeue result.

Note that if a pull-dequeue has a NULL result because the target FQ/channel
was empty, then this function will also return NULL (rather than expecting
the caller to always check for this. As such, "is_last" can be used to
differentiate between "end-of-empty-dequeue" and "still-waiting".

Return dequeue result for a valid dequeue result, or NULL for empty dequeue.
