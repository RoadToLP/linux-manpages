.SH NAME
ssam_controller_init \- Initialize SSAM controller.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" ssam_controller_init
.BI "(struct ssam_controller *ctrl "  ","
.BI "struct serdev_device *serdev "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "ctrl" 12
The controller to initialize.
.IP "serdev" 12
The serial device representing the underlying data transport.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Initializes the given controller. Does neither start receiver nor
transmitter threads. After this call, the controller has to be hooked up to
the serdev core separately via \fIstruct serdev_device_ops\fP, relaying calls to
\fBssam_controller_receive_buf\fP and \fBssam_controller_write_wakeup\fP. Once the
controller has been hooked up, transmitter and receiver threads may be
started via \fBssam_controller_start\fP. These setup steps need to be completed
before controller can be used for requests.
