.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Returns NULL if the task has no mm.  Checks PF_KTHREAD (meaning
this kernel workthread has transiently adopted a user mm with use_mm,
to do its AIO) is not set and if so returns a reference to it, after
bumping up the use count.  User must release the mm via \fBmmput\fP
after use.  Typically used by /proc and ptrace.
