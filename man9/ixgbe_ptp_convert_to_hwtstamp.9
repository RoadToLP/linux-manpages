unsigned 64bit system time value
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
We need to convert the adapter's RX/TXSTMP registers into a hwtstamp value
which can be used by the stack's ptp functions.

The lock is used to protect consistency of the cyclecounter and the SYSTIME
registers. However, it does not need to protect against the Rx or Tx
timestamp registers, as there can't be a new timestamp until the old one is
unlatched by reading.

In addition to the timestamp in hardware, some controllers need a software
overflow cyclecounter, and this function takes this into account as well.
