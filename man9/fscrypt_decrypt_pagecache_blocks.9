.SH NAME
fscrypt_decrypt_pagecache_blocks \- Decrypt filesystem blocks in a pagecache page
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" fscrypt_decrypt_pagecache_blocks
.BI "(struct page *page "  ","
.BI "unsigned int len "  ","
.BI "unsigned int offs "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "page" 12
The locked pagecache page containing the block(s) to decrypt
.IP "len" 12
Total size of the block(s) to decrypt.  Must be a nonzero
multiple of the filesystem's block size.
.IP "offs" 12
Byte offset within \fIpage\fP of the first block to decrypt.  Must be
a multiple of the filesystem's block size.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The specified block(s) are decrypted in-place within the pagecache page,
which must still be locked and not uptodate.  Normally, blocksize ==
PAGE_SIZE and the whole page is decrypted at once.

This is for use by the filesystem's ->\fBreadpages\fP method.
.SH "RETURN"
