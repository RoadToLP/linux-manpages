Returns 0 on success, a negative error code otherwise.

FIFO watermark threshold is computed based on the required watermark values
set for gyro and accel sensors. Since watermark is all about acceptable data
latency, use the smallest setting between the 2. It means choosing the
smallest latency but this is not as simple as choosing the smallest watermark
value. Latency depends on watermark and ODR. It requires several steps:
1) compute gyro and accel latencies and choose the smallest value.
2) adapt the choosen latency so that it is a multiple of both gyro and accel
ones. Otherwise it is possible that you don't meet a requirement. (for
example with gyro \fI100Hz\fP wm 4 and accel \fI100Hz\fP with wm 6, choosing the
value of 4 will not meet accel latency requirement because 6 is not a
multiple of 4. You need to use the value 2.)
3) Since all periods are multiple of each others, watermark is computed by
dividing this computed latency by the smallest period, which corresponds
to the FIFO frequency. Beware that this is only true because we are not
using 500Hz frequency which is not a multiple of the others.
