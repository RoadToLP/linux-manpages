.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function calls unregister_command_q, then clears interrupts and
any pending interrupt acknowledgments associated with the command q.
It also clears memory if there is no error.

PHYP did not meet the PAPR architecture so that we must give up the
lock. This causes a timing hole regarding state change.  To close the
hole this routine does accounting on any change that occurred during
the time the lock is not held.
EXECUTION ENVIRONMENT:
Process level, interrupt lock is held
.SH "NOTE"
must give up and then acquire the interrupt lock, the caller must
make sure that state and or flags will prevent interrupt handler from
scheduling work.
