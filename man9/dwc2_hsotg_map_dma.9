.SH "DESCRIPTION"
We've been asked to queue a request, so ensure that the memory buffer
is correctly setup for DMA. If we've been passed an extant DMA address
then ensure the buffer has been synced to memory. If our buffer has no
DMA memory, then we map the memory and mark our request to allow us to
cleanup on completion.
