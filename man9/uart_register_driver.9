uart_register_driver \- register a driver with the uart core layer
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" uart_register_driver
.BI "(struct uart_driver *drv "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "drv" 12
low level driver structure

Register a uart driver with the core driver.  We in turn register
with the tty layer, and initialise the core driver per-port state.

We have a proc file in /proc/tty/driver which is named after the
normal driver.

drv->port should be NULL, and the per-port structures should be
registered using uart_add_one_port after this call has succeeded.
