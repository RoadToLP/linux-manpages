.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "queue" 12
-- undescribed --
.IP "skb" 12
skb that the HW header should be added to.
.IP "hdr" 12
double pointer to a qeth_hdr. When returning with >= 0,
it contains a valid pointer to a qeth_hdr.
.IP "hdr_len" 12
length of the HW header.
.IP "proto_len" 12
length of protocol headers that need to be in same page as the
HW header.
.IP "elements" 12
-- undescribed --
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Returns the pushed length. If the header can't be pushed on
(eg. because it would cross a page boundary), it is allocated from
the cache instead and 0 is returned.
The number of needed buffer elements is returned in \fIelements\fP.
Error to create the hdr is indicated by returning with < 0.
