.SH NAME
blkcg_maybe_throttle_current \- throttle the current task if it has been marked
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" blkcg_maybe_throttle_current
.BI "(void "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "void" 12
no arguments
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

This is only called if we've been marked with \fBset_notify_resume\fP.  Obviously
we can be \fBset_notify_resume\fP for reasons other than blkcg throttling, so we
check to see if current->throttle_queue is set and if not this doesn't do
anything.  This should only ever be called by the resume code, it's not meant
to be called by people willy-nilly as it will actually do the work to
throttle the task if it is setup for throttling.
