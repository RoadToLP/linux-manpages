.BI "(MPT_ADAPTER *ioc "  ","
.BI "struct pci_dev *pdev "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "ioc" 12
Pointer to MPT adapter structure
.IP "pdev" 12
Pointer to (struct pci_dev) structure

Search for PCI bus/dev_function which matches
PCI bus/dev_function (+/-1) for newly discovered 929,
929X, 1030 or 1035.

If match on PCI dev_function +/-1 is found, bind the two MPT adapters
using alt_ioc pointer fields in their MPT_ADAPTER structures.
