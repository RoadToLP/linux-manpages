if not ICE_FLOW_FLD_OFF_INVAL, location of the value to match from
entry's input buffer
.IP "mask_loc" 12
if not ICE_FLOW_FLD_OFF_INVAL, location of mask value from entry's
input buffer

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This helper function stores information of a field being matched, including
the type of the field and the locations of the value to match, the mask, and
the upper-bound value in the start of the input buffer for a flow entry.
This function should only be used for fixed-size data structures.

This function also opportunistically determines the protocol headers to be
present based on the fields being set. Some fields cannot be used alone to
determine the protocol headers present. Sometimes, fields for particular
protocol headers are not matched. In those cases, the protocol headers
must be explicitly set.
