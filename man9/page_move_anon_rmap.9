.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" page_move_anon_rmap
.BI "(struct page *page "  ","
.BI "struct vm_area_struct *vma "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "page" 12
the page to move to our anon_vma
.IP "vma" 12
the vma the page belongs to

When a page belongs exclusively to one process after a COW event,
that page can be moved into the anon_vma that belongs to just that
process, so the rmap code will not search the parent or sibling
processes.
