.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" handle_untracked_irq
.BI "(struct irq_desc *desc "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "desc" 12
the interrupt description structure for this irq

Untracked interrupts are sent from a demultiplexing interrupt
handler when the demultiplexer does not know which device it its
multiplexed irq domain generated the interrupt. IRQ's handled
through here are not subjected to stats tracking, randomness, or
spurious interrupt detection.
.SH "NOTE"
Like handle_simple_irq, the caller is expected to handle
the ack, clear, mask and unmask issues if necessary.
