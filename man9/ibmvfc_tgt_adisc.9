ibmvfc_tgt_adisc \- Initiate an ADISC for specified target
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" ibmvfc_tgt_adisc
.BI "(struct ibmvfc_target *tgt "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "tgt" 12
ibmvfc target struct
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
When sending an ADISC we end up with two timers running. The
first timer is the timer in the ibmvfc target struct. If this
fires, we send a cancel to the target. The second timer is the
timer on the ibmvfc event for the ADISC, which is longer. If that
fires, it means the ADISC timed out and our attempt to cancel it
also failed, so we need to reset the CRQ.
