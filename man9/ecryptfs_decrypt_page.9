.SH NAME
ecryptfs_decrypt_page \- 
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" ecryptfs_decrypt_page
.BI "(struct page *page "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "page" 12
Page mapped from the eCryptfs inode for the file; data read
and decrypted from the lower file will be written into this
page
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Decrypt an eCryptfs page. This is done on a per-extent basis. Note
that eCryptfs pages may straddle the lower pages -- for instance,
if the file was created on a machine with an 8K page size
(resulting in an 8K header), and then the file is copied onto a
host with a 32K page size, then when reading page 0 of the eCryptfs
file, 24K of page 0 of the lower file will be read and decrypted,
and then 8K of page 1 of the lower file will be read and decrypted.

Returns zero on success; negative on error
