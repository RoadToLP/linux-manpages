.SH NAME
resume_needed \- Check whether to resume a device before system suspend.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "bool" resume_needed
.BI "(struct device *dev "  ","
.BI "const struct generic_pm_domain *genpd "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dev" 12
Device to check.
.IP "genpd" 12
PM domain the device belongs to.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
There are two cases in which a device that can wake up the system from sleep
states should be resumed by \fBgenpd_prepare\fP: (1) if the device is enabled
to wake up the system and it has to remain active for this purpose while the
system is in the sleep state and (2) if the device is not enabled to wake up
the system from sleep states and it generally doesn't generate wakeup signals
by itself (those signals are generated on its behalf by other parts of the
system).  In the latter case it may be necessary to reconfigure the device's
wakeup settings during system suspend, because it may have been set up to
signal remote wakeup from the system's working state as needed by runtime PM.
Return 'true' in either of the above cases.
