.SH NAME
fscrypt_mergeable_bio \- test whether data can be added to a bio
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "bool" fscrypt_mergeable_bio
.BI "(struct bio *bio "  ","
.BI "const struct inode *inode "  ","
.BI "u64 next_lblk "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "bio" 12
the bio being built up
.IP "inode" 12
the inode for the next part of the I/O
.IP "next_lblk" 12
the next file logical block number in the I/O
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
When building a bio which may contain data which should undergo inline
encryption (or decryption) via fscrypt, filesystems should call this function
to ensure that the resulting bio contains only contiguous data unit numbers.
This will return false if the next part of the I/O cannot be merged with the
bio because either the encryption key would be different or the encryption
data unit numbers would be discontiguous.

\fBfscrypt_set_bio_crypt_ctx\fP must have already been called on the bio.
.SH "RETURN"
true iff the I/O is mergeable
