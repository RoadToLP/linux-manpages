.SH NAME
acpi_dev_resource_interrupt \- Extract ACPI interrupt resource information.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "bool" acpi_dev_resource_interrupt
.BI "(struct acpi_resource *ares "  ","
.BI "int index "  ","
.BI "struct resource *res "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "ares" 12
Input ACPI resource object.
.IP "index" 12
Index into the array of GSIs represented by the resource.
.IP "res" 12
Output generic resource object.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Check if the given ACPI resource object represents an interrupt resource
and \fIindex\fP does not exceed the resource's interrupt count (true is returned
in that case regardless of the results of the other checks)).  If that's the
case, register the GSI corresponding to \fIindex\fP from the array of interrupts
represented by the resource and populate the generic resource object pointed
to by \fIres\fP accordingly.  If the registration of the GSI is not successful,
IORESOURCE_DISABLED will be set it that object's flags.
.SH "RETURN"
1) false with res->flags setting to zero: not the expected resource type
2) false with IORESOURCE_DISABLED in res->flags: valid unassigned resource
3) true: valid assigned resource
