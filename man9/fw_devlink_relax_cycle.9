.SH NAME
fw_devlink_relax_cycle \- Convert cyclic links to SYNC_STATE_ONLY links
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" fw_devlink_relax_cycle
.BI "(struct device *con "  ","
.BI "void *sup "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "con" 12
Device to check dependencies for.
.IP "sup" 12
Device to check against.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Check if \fIsup\fP depends on \fIcon\fP or any device dependent on it (its child or
its consumer etc).  When such a cyclic dependency is found, convert all
device links created solely by fw_devlink into SYNC_STATE_ONLY device links.
This is the equivalent of doing fw_devlink=permissive just between the
devices in the cycle. We need to do this because, at this point, fw_devlink
can't tell which of these dependencies is not a real dependency.

Return 1 if a cycle is found. Otherwise, return 0.
