.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Given the client-provided Read, Write, and Reply chunks, the
server was not able to parse the Call or form a complete Reply.
Return an RDMA_ERROR message so the client can retire the RPC
transaction.

The caller does not have to release \fIsctxt\fP. It is released by
Send completion, or by this function on error.
