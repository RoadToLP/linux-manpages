.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Instructs a non-CORE DPLL to enter low-power bypass mode.  In
bypass mode, the DPLL's rate is set equal to its parent clock's
rate.  Waits for the DPLL to report readiness before returning.
Will save and restore the DPLL's autoidle state across the enable,
per the CDP code.  If the DPLL entered bypass mode successfully,
return 0; if the DPLL did not enter bypass in the time allotted, or
DPLL3 was passed in, or the DPLL does not support low-power bypass,
return -EINVAL.
