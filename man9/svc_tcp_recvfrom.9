Called in a loop when XPT_DATA has been set.

in that marker to set up exactly the resources needed to receive
the next RPC message into \fIrqstp\fP.

The zero return case handles partial receives and callback Replies.
The state of a partial receive is preserved in the svc_sock for
the next call to svc_tcp_recvfrom.
.SH "RETURN"
On success, the number of bytes in a received RPC Call, or
0 if a complete RPC Call message was not ready to return
