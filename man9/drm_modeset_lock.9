.SH NAME
drm_modeset_lock \- take modeset lock
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" drm_modeset_lock
.BI "(struct drm_modeset_lock *lock "  ","
.BI "struct drm_modeset_acquire_ctx *ctx "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "lock" 12
lock to take
.IP "ctx" 12
acquire ctx
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
If \fIctx\fP is not NULL, then its ww acquire context is used and the
lock will be tracked by the context and can be released by calling
\fBdrm_modeset_drop_locks\fP.  If -EDEADLK is returned, this means a
deadlock scenario has been detected and it is an error to attempt
to take any more locks without first calling \fBdrm_modeset_backoff\fP.

If the \fIctx\fP is not NULL and initialized with
DRM_MODESET_ACQUIRE_INTERRUPTIBLE, this function will fail with
-ERESTARTSYS when interrupted.

If \fIctx\fP is NULL then the function call behaves like a normal,
uninterruptible non-nesting \fBmutex_lock\fP call.
