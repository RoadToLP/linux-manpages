frame buffer structure

We setup the framebuffer structures according to the current
hardware setup. On some machines, the BIOS will have filled
the chip registers with such info, on others, these values will
have been written in some init procedure. In any case, the
software values needs to match the hardware ones. This is what
this function ensures.
.SH "NOTE"
some of the hardcoded values here might need some love to
work on various chips, and might need to no longer be hardcoded.
