.SH NAME
rhashtable_shrink \- Shrink hash table while allowing concurrent lookups
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" rhashtable_shrink
.BI "(struct rhashtable *ht "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "ht" 12
the hash table to shrink
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function shrinks the hash table to fit, i.e., the smallest
size would not cause it to expand right away automatically.

The caller must ensure that no concurrent resizing occurs by holding
ht->mutex.

The caller must ensure that no concurrent table mutations take place.
It is however valid to have concurrent lookups if they are RCU protected.

It is valid to have concurrent insertions and deletions protected by per
bucket locks or concurrent RCU protected lookups and traversals.
