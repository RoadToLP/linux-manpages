.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Start at the beginning of the kmsg buffer, with the oldest kmsg
record, and copy one record into the provided buffer.

Consecutive calls will return the next available record moving
towards the end of the buffer with the youngest messages.

A return value of FALSE indicates that there are no more records to
read.

The function is similar to \fBkmsg_dump_get_line\fP, but grabs no locks.
