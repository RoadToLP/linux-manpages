socket to calculate one way delay for
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Calculate one way delay (in relative format).
Original implement OWD as minus of remote time difference to local time
difference directly. As this time difference just simply equal to RTT, when
the network status is stable, remote RTT will equal to local RTT, and result
OWD into zero.
It seems to be a bug and so we fixed it.
