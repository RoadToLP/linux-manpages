.SH NAME
fsverity_get_hash_alg \- validate and prepare a hash algorithm
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "struct fsverity_hash_alg *" fsverity_get_hash_alg
.BI "(const struct inode *inode "  ","
.BI "unsigned int num "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "inode" 12
optional inode for logging purposes
.IP "num" 12
the hash algorithm number
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Get the struct fsverity_hash_alg for the given hash algorithm number, and
ensure it has a hash transform ready to go.  The hash transforms are
allocated on-demand so that we don't waste resources unnecessarily, and
because the crypto modules may be initialized later than fs/verity/.
.SH "RETURN"
pointer to the hash alg on success, else an \fBERR_PTR\fP
