.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "phba" 12
Pointer to HBA context object.
.IP "piocb" 12
Pointer to command iocb.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
For SLI4 only, FCP IO can deferred to one fo many WQs, based on
hba_wqidx, thus we need to calculate the corresponding ring.
Since ABORTS must go on the same WQ of the command they are
aborting, we use command's hba_wqidx.
