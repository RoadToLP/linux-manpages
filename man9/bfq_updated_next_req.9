.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" bfq_updated_next_req
.BI "(struct bfq_data *bfqd "  ","
.BI "struct bfq_queue *bfqq "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "bfqd" 12
the device data the queue belongs to.
.IP "bfqq" 12
the queue to update.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
If the first request of a queue changes we make sure that the queue
has enough budget to serve at least its first request (if the
request has grown).  We do this because if the queue has not enough
budget for its first request, it has to go through two dispatch
rounds to actually get it dispatched.
