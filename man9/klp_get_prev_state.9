.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "struct klp_state *" klp_get_prev_state
.BI "(unsigned long id "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Checks whether already installed livepatches modify the given
system state.

The same system state can be modified by more non-cumulative
livepatches. It is expected that the latest livepatch has
the most up-to-date information.

The function can be called only during transition when a new
livepatch is being enabled or when such a transition is reverted.
It is typically called only from pre/post (un)patch
callbacks.
.SH "RETURN"
pointer to the latest struct klp_state from already
installed livepatches, NULL when not found.
