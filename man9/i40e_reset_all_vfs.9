.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "pf" 12

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Reset all allocated VFs in one go. First, tell the hardware to reset each
VF, then do all the waiting in one chunk, and finally finish restoring each
VF after the wait. This is useful during PF routines which need to reset
all VFs, as otherwise it must perform these resets in a serialized fashion.

Returns true if any VFs were reset, and false otherwise.
