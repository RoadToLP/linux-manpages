.SH NAME
i915_gem_gtt_reserve \- reserve a node in an address_space (GTT)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" i915_gem_gtt_reserve
.BI "(struct i915_address_space *vm "  ","
.BI "struct drm_mm_node *node "  ","
.BI "u64 size "  ","
.BI "u64 offset "  ","
.BI "unsigned long color "  ","
.BI "unsigned int flags "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "vm" 12
the \fIstruct i915_address_space\fP
.IP "node" 12
the \fIstruct drm_mm_node\fP (typically i915_vma.mode)
.IP "size" 12
how much space to allocate inside the GTT,
must be #I915_GTT_PAGE_SIZE aligned
.IP "offset" 12
where to insert inside the GTT,
must be #I915_GTT_MIN_ALIGNMENT aligned, and the node
(\fIoffset\fP + \fIsize\fP) must fit within the address space
.IP "color" 12
color to apply to node, if this node is not from a VMA,
color must be #I915_COLOR_UNEVICTABLE
.IP "flags" 12
control search and eviction behaviour
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBi915_gem_gtt_reserve\fP tries to insert the \fInode\fP at the exact \fIoffset\fP inside
the address space (using \fIsize\fP and \fIcolor\fP). If the \fInode\fP does not fit, it
tries to evict any overlapping nodes from the GTT, including any
neighbouring nodes if the colors do not match (to ensure guard pages between
differing domains). See \fBi915_gem_evict_for_node\fP for the gory details
on the eviction algorithm. #PIN_NONBLOCK may used to prevent waiting on
evicting active overlapping objects, and any overlapping node that is pinned
or marked as unevictable will also result in failure.
.SH "RETURN"
0 on success, -ENOSPC if no suitable hole is found, -EINTR if
asked to wait for eviction and interrupted.
