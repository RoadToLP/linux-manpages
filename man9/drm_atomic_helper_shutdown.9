DRM device
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This shuts down all CRTC, which is useful for driver unloading. Shutdown on
suspend should instead be handled with \fBdrm_atomic_helper_suspend\fP, since
that also takes a snapshot of the modeset state to be restored on resume.

This is just a convenience wrapper around \fBdrm_atomic_helper_disable_all\fP,
and it is the atomic version of \fBdrm_crtc_force_disable_all\fP.
