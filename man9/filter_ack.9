.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This functions looks for ACK packets and tries to match them with the
frames in the tx queue. If a match is found the frame will be dequeued and
the upper layers is informed about the successful transmission. If
mac80211 queues have been stopped and the number of frames still to be
transmitted is low the queues will be opened again.

Returns 1 if the frame was an ACK, 0 if it was ignored.
