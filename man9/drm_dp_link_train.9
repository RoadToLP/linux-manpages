drm_dp_link_train \- perform DisplayPort link training
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" drm_dp_link_train
.BI "(struct drm_dp_link *link "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "link" 12
a DP link object
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Uses the context stored in the DP link object to perform link training. It
is expected that drivers will call \fBdrm_dp_link_probe\fP to obtain the link
capabilities before performing link training.

If the sink supports fast link training (no AUX CH handshake) and valid
training settings are available, this function will try to perform fast
link training and fall back to full link training on failure.
.SH "RETURN"
0 on success or a negative error code on failure.
