.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Enable the ondemand enabling/disabling of the display power wells. Note that
power wells not belonging to POWER_DOMAIN_INIT are allowed to be toggled
only at specific points of the display modeset sequence, thus they are not
affected by the \fBintel_power_domains_enable\fP/\fBdisable\fP calls. The purpose
of these function is to keep the rest of power wells enabled until the end
of display HW readout (which will acquire the power references reflecting
the current HW state).
