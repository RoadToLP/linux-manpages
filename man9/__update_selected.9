Update the value of the selected variable, using parameter values from a
newly received lacpdu. The parameter values for the Actor carried in the
received PDU are compared with the corresponding operational parameter
values for the ports partner. If one or more of the comparisons shows that
the value(s) received in the PDU differ from the current operational values,
then selected is set to FALSE and actor_oper_port_state.synchronization is
set to out_of_sync. Otherwise, selected remains unchanged.
