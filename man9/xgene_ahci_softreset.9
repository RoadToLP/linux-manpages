.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Due to H/W errata, the controller is unable to save the PMP
field fetched from command header before sending the H2D FIS.
When the device returns the PMP port field in the D2H FIS, there is
a mismatch and results in command completion failure. The workaround
is to write the pmp value to PxFBS.DEV field before issuing any command
to PMP. Here is the algorithm to detect PMP :

1. Save the PxFBS value
2. Program PxFBS.DEV with pmp value send by framework. Framework sends
0xF for both PMP/NON-PMP initially
3. Issue softreset
4. If signature class is PMP goto 6
5. restore the original PxFBS and goto 3
6. return
