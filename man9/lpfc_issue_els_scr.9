retry counter for the command IOCB.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This routine issues a State Change Request (SCR) to a fabric node
on a \fIvport\fP. The remote node is Fabric Controller (0xfffffd). It
first search the \fIvport\fP node list to find the matching ndlp. If no such
ndlp is found, a new ndlp shall be created for this (SCR) purpose. An
IOCB is allocated, payload prepared, and the \fBlpfc_sli_issue_iocb\fP
routine is invoked to send the SCR IOCB.

Note that, in \fBlpfc_prep_els_iocb\fP routine, the reference count of ndlp
will be incremented by 1 for holding the ndlp and the reference to ndlp
will be stored into the context1 field of the IOCB for the completion
callback function to the SCR ELS command.

Return code
0 - Successfully issued scr command
1 - Failed to issue scr command
