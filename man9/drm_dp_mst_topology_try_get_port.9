drm_dp_mst_topology_try_get_port \- Increment the topology refcount of a port unless it's zero

.BI "(struct drm_dp_mst_port *port "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS

\fIstruct drm_dp_mst_port\fP to increment the topology refcount of
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Attempts to grab a topology reference to \fIport\fP, if it hasn't yet been
removed from the topology (e.g. \fIdrm_dp_mst_port.topology_kref\fP has reached
0). Holding a topology reference implies that a malloc reference will be
held to \fIport\fP as long as the user holds the topology reference.

Care should be taken to ensure that the user has at least one malloc
reference to \fIport\fP. If you already have a topology reference to \fIport\fP, you
should use \fBdrm_dp_mst_topology_get_port\fP instead.

.SH "RETURN"
* 1: A topology reference was grabbed successfully
* 0: \fIport\fP is no longer in the topology, no reference was grabbed
