.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Generate a cpufreq table for a provided device- this assumes that the
opp table is already initialized and ready for usage.

This function allocates required memory for the cpufreq table. It is
expected that the caller does the required maintenance such as freeing
the table as required.

Returns -EINVAL for bad pointers, -ENODEV if the device is not found, -ENOMEM
if no memory available for the operation (table is not populated), returns 0
if successful and table is populated.

WARNING: It is  important for the callers to ensure refreshing their copy of
the table if any of the mentioned functions have been invoked in the interim.
