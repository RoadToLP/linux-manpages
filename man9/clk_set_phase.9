.SH NAME
clk_set_phase \- adjust the phase shift of a clock signal
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" clk_set_phase
.BI "(struct clk *clk "  ","
.BI "int degrees "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "clk" 12
clock signal source
.IP "degrees" 12
number of degrees the signal is shifted
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Shifts the phase of a clock signal by the specified
degrees. Returns 0 on success, -EERROR otherwise.

This function makes no distinction about the input or reference
signal that we adjust the clock signal phase against. For example
phase locked-loop clock signal generators we may shift phase with
respect to feedback clock signal input, but for other cases the
clock phase may be shifted with respect to some other, unspecified
signal.

Additionally the concept of phase shift does not propagate through
the clock tree hierarchy, which sets it apart from clock rates and
clock accuracy. A parent clock phase attribute does not have an
impact on the phase attribute of a child clock.
