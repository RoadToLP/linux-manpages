.SH NAME
ice_vsi_map_rings_to_vectors \- Map VSI rings to interrupt vectors
.SH SYNOPSIS

.BI "(struct ice_vsi *vsi "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "vsi" 12
the VSI being configured
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function maps descriptor rings to the queue-specific vectors allotted
through the MSI-X enabling code. On a constrained vector budget, we map Tx
and Rx rings to the vector as "efficiently" as possible.
