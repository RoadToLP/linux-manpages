This function will initiate a mailbox connection.  It will populate the
mailbox with a broadcast connect message and then initialize the lock.
This is safe since the connect message is a single DWORD so the mailbox
transaction is guaranteed to be atomic.

This function will return an error if the mailbox has not been initiated
or is currently in use.
