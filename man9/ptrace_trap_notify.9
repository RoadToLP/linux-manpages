.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "t" 12
tracee wanting to notify tracer
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function schedules sticky ptrace trap which is cleared on the next
TRAP_STOP to notify ptracer of an event.  \fIt\fP must have been seized by
ptracer.

If \fIt\fP is running, STOP trap will be taken.  If trapped for STOP and
ptracer is listening for events, tracee is woken up so that it can
re-trap for the new event.  If trapped otherwise, STOP trap will be
eventually taken without returning to userland after the existing traps
are finished by PTRACE_CONT.
.SH "CONTEXT"
Must be called with \fItask->sighand->siglock\fP held.
