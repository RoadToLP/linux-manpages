.SH NAME
qbman_result_has_new_result \- Check and get the dequeue response from the dq storage memory set in pull dequeue command
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" qbman_result_has_new_result
.BI "(struct qbman_swp *s "  ","
.BI "const struct dpaa2_dq *dq "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "s" 12
the software portal object
.IP "dq" 12
the dequeue result read from the memory
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Return 1 for getting a valid dequeue result, or 0 for not getting a valid
dequeue result.

Only used for user-provided storage of dequeue results, not DQRR. For
efficiency purposes, the driver will perform any required endianness
conversion to ensure that the user's dequeue result storage is in host-endian
format. As such, once the user has called \fBqbman_result_has_new_result\fP and
been returned a valid dequeue result, they should not call it again on
the same memory location (except of course if another dequeue command has
been executed to produce a new result to that location).
