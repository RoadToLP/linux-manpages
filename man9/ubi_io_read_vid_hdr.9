.SH NAME
ubi_io_read_vid_hdr \- read and check a volume identifier header.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" ubi_io_read_vid_hdr
.BI "(struct ubi_device *ubi "  ","
.BI "int pnum "  ","
.BI "struct ubi_vid_io_buf *vidb "  ","
.BI "int verbose "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "ubi" 12
UBI device description object
.IP "pnum" 12
physical eraseblock number to read from
.IP "vidb" 12
the volume identifier buffer to store data in
.IP "verbose" 12
be verbose if the header is corrupted or wasn't found
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function reads the volume identifier header from physical eraseblock
\fIpnum\fP and stores it in \fIvidb\fP. It also checks CRC checksum of the read
volume identifier header. The error codes are the same as in
'\fBubi_io_read_ec_hdr\fP'.

Note, the implementation of this function is also very similar to
'\fBubi_io_read_ec_hdr\fP', so refer commentaries in '\fBubi_io_read_ec_hdr\fP'.
