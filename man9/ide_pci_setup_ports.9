Scan the interfaces attached to this device and do any
necessary per port setup. Attach the devices and ask the
generic DMA layer to do its work for us.

Normally called automaticall from do_ide_pci_setup_device,
but is also used directly as a helper function by some controllers
where the chipset setup is not the default PCI IDE one.
