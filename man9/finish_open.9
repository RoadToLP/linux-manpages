.SH NAME
finish_open \- finish opening a file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" finish_open
.BI "(struct file *file "  ","
.BI "struct dentry *dentry "  ","
.BI "int (*open)(struct inode *, struct file *) "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "file" 12
file pointer
.IP "dentry" 12
pointer to dentry
.IP "open" 12
open callback
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This can be used to finish opening a file passed to i_op->\fBatomic_open\fP.

If the open callback is set to NULL, then the standard f_op->\fBopen\fP
filesystem callback is substituted.

NB: the dentry reference is _not_ consumed.  If, for example, the dentry is
the return value of \fBd_splice_alias\fP, then the caller needs to perform \fBdput\fP
on it after \fBfinish_open\fP.

Returns zero on success or -errno if the open failed.
