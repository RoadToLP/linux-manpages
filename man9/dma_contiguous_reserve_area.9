Base address of the reserved area optional, use 0 for any
.IP "limit" 12
End address of the reserved memory (optional, 0 for any).

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function reserves memory from early allocator. It should be
called by arch specific code once the early allocator (memblock or bootmem)
has been activated and all other subsystems have already allocated/reserved
memory. This function allows to create custom reserved areas for specific
devices.

If \fIfixed\fP is true, reserve contiguous area at exactly \fIbase\fP.  If false,
reserve in range from \fIbase\fP to \fIlimit\fP.
