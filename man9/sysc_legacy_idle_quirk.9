.SH NAME
sysc_legacy_idle_quirk \- handle children in omap_device compatible way
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" sysc_legacy_idle_quirk
.BI "(struct sysc *ddata "  ","
.BI "struct device *child "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "ddata" 12
device driver data
.IP "child" 12
child device driver
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Allow idle for child devices as done with \fB_od_runtime_suspend\fP.
Otherwise many child devices will not idle because of the permanent
parent usecount set in \fBpm_runtime_irq_safe\fP.

Note that the long term solution is to just modify the child device
drivers to not set \fBpm_runtime_irq_safe\fP and then this can be just
dropped.
