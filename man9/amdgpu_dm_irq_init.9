.SH NAME
amdgpu_dm_irq_init \- Initialize DM IRQ management
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" amdgpu_dm_irq_init
.BI "(struct amdgpu_device *adev "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "adev" 12
The base driver device containing the DM device
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Initialize DM's high and low context IRQ tables.

The N by M table contains N IRQ sources, with M
\fIstruct amdgpu_dm_irq_handler_data\fP hooked together in a linked list. The
list_heads are initialized here. When an interrupt n is triggered, all m
handlers are called in sequence, FIFO according to registration order.

The low context table requires special steps to initialize, since handlers
will be deferred to a workqueue. See \fIstruct irq_list_head\fP.
