.SH NAME
vmw_validation_drop_ht \- Reset the hash table used for duplicate finding and unregister it from this validation context.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" vmw_validation_drop_ht
.BI "(struct vmw_validation_context *ctx "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "ctx" 12
The validation context.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The hash table used for duplicate finding is an expensive resource and
may be protected by mutexes that may cause deadlocks during resource
unreferencing if held. After resource- and buffer object registering,
there is no longer any use for this hash table, so allow freeing it
either to shorten any mutex locking time, or before resources- and
buffer objects are freed during validation context cleanup.
