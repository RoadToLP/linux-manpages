__pskb_pull_tail \- advance tail of skb header
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void *" __pskb_pull_tail
.BI "(struct sk_buff *skb "  ","
.BI "int delta "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "skb" 12
buffer to reallocate
.IP "delta" 12

The function makes a sense only on a fragmented \fIsk_buff\fP,
it expands header moving its tail forward and copying necessary
data from fragmented part.

\fIsk_buff\fP MUST have reference count of 1.

Returns NULL (and \fIsk_buff\fP does not change) if pull failed
or value of new tail of skb in the case of success.

All the pointers pointing into skb header may change and must be
reloaded after call to this function.
