.SH NAME
xdr_commit_encode \- Ensure all data is written to buffer
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" xdr_commit_encode
.BI "(struct xdr_stream *xdr "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "xdr" 12
pointer to xdr_stream
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
We handle encoding across page boundaries by giving the caller a
temporary location to write to, then later copying the data into
place; xdr_commit_encode does that copying.

Normally the caller doesn't need to call this directly, as the
following xdr_reserve_space will do it.  But an explicit call may be
required at the end of encoding, or any other time when the xdr_buf
data might be read.
