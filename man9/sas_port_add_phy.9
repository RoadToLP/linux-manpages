.BI "struct sas_phy *phy "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "port" 12

.IP "phy" 12
phy to add
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
When a port is initially created, it is empty (has no phys).  All
ports must have at least one phy to operated, and all wide ports
must have at least two.  The current code makes no difference
between ports and wide ports, but the only object that can be
connected to a remote device is a port, so ports must be formed on
all devices with phys if they're connected to anything.
