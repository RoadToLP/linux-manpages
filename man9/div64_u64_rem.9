.SH NAME
div64_u64_rem \- unsigned 64bit divide with 64bit divisor and remainder
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "u64" div64_u64_rem
.BI "(u64 dividend "  ","
.BI "u64 divisor "  ","
.BI "u64 *remainder "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dividend" 12
64bit dividend
.IP "divisor" 12
64bit divisor
.IP "remainder" 12
64bit remainder
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This implementation is a comparable to algorithm used by div64_u64.
But this operation, which includes math for calculating the remainder,
is kept distinct to avoid slowing down the div64_u64 operation on 32bit
systems.
