.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Load system registers that do not affect the host's execution, for
example EL1 system registers on a VHE system where the host kernel
runs at EL2.  This function is called from KVM's \fBvcpu_load\fP function
and loading system register state early avoids having to load them on
every entry to the VM.
