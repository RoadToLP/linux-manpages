.SH NAME
smk_access_entry \- look up matching access rule
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" smk_access_entry
.BI "(char *subject_label "  ","
.BI "char *object_label "  ","
.BI "struct list_head *rule_list "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "subject_label" 12
a pointer to the subject's Smack label
.IP "object_label" 12
a pointer to the object's Smack label
.IP "rule_list" 12
the list of rules to search
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function looks up the subject/object pair in the
access rule list and returns the access mode. If no
entry is found returns -ENOENT.

Earlier versions of this function allowed for labels that
were not on the label list. This was done to allow for
labels to come over the network that had never been seen
before on this host. Unless the receiving socket has the
star label this will always result in a failure check. The
star labeled socket case is now handled in the networking
hooks so there is no case where the label is not on the
label list. Checking to see if the address of two labels
is the same is now a reliable test.

Do the object check first because that is more
likely to differ.

Allowing write access implies allowing locking.
