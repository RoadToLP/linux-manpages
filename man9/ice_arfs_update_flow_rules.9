Iterate over the hlist at the index given in the aRFS hash table and
determine if there are any aRFS entries that need to be either added or
deleted in the HW. If the aRFS entry is marked as ICE_ARFS_INACTIVE the
filter needs to be added to HW, else if it's marked as ICE_ARFS_ACTIVE and
the flow has expired delete the filter from HW. The caller of this function
is expected to add/delete rules on the add_list/del_list respectively.
