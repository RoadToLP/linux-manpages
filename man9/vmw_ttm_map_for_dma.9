.SH NAME
vmw_ttm_map_for_dma \- map TTM pages to get device addresses
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" vmw_ttm_map_for_dma
.BI "(struct vmw_ttm_tt *vmw_tt "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "vmw_tt" 12
Pointer to a struct vmw_ttm_backend
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function is used to get device addresses from the kernel DMA layer.
However, it's violating the DMA API in that when this operation has been
performed, it's illegal for the CPU to write to the pages without first
unmapping the DMA mappings, or calling \fBdma_sync_sg_for_cpu\fP. It is
therefore only legal to call this function if we know that the function
\fBdma_sync_sg_for_cpu\fP is a NOP, and \fBdma_sync_sg_for_device\fP is at most
a CPU write buffer flush.
