.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dev" 12
valid struct device pointer, or NULL for ISA and EISA-like devices
.IP "sg" 12
list of buffers
.IP "nents" 12

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Map a set of buffers described by scatterlist in streaming mode for DMA.
This is the scatter-gather version of the dma_map_single interface.
Here the scatter gather list elements are each tagged with the
appropriate dma address and length.  They are obtained via
sg_dma_{address,length}.

Device ownership issues as mentioned for dma_map_single are the same
here.
