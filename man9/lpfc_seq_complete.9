.SH NAME
lpfc_seq_complete \- Indicates if a sequence is complete
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" lpfc_seq_complete
.BI "(struct hbq_dmabuf *dmabuf "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dmabuf" 12
pointer to a dmabuf that describes the FC sequence
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function checks the sequence, starting with the frame described by
\fIdmabuf\fP, to see if all the frames associated with this sequence are present.
the frames associated with this sequence are linked to the \fIdmabuf\fP using the
dbuf list. This function looks for two major things. 1) That the first frame
has a sequence count of zero. 2) There is a frame with last frame of sequence
set. 3) That there are no holes in the sequence count. The function will
return 1 when the sequence is complete, otherwise it will return 0.
