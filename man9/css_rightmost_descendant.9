.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Return the rightmost descendant of \fIpos\fP.  If there's no descendant, \fIpos\fP
is returned.  This can be used during pre-order traversal to skip
subtree of \fIpos\fP.

While this function requires cgroup_mutex or RCU read locking, it
doesn't require the whole traversal to be contained in a single critical
section.  This function will return the correct rightmost descendant as
long as \fIpos\fP is accessible.
