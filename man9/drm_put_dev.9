Called at module unload time or when a PCI device is unplugged.

Cleans up all DRM device, calling \fBdrm_lastclose\fP.
.SH "NOTE"
Use of this function is deprecated. It will eventually go away
completely.  Please use \fBdrm_dev_unregister\fP and \fBdrm_dev_put\fP explicitly
instead to make sure that the device isn't userspace accessible any more
while teardown is in progress, ensuring that userspace can't access an
inconsistent state.
