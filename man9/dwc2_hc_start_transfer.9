.SH NAME
dwc2_hc_start_transfer \- Does the setup for a data transfer for a host channel and starts the transfer
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" dwc2_hc_start_transfer
.BI "(struct dwc2_hsotg *hsotg "  ","
.BI "struct dwc2_host_chan *chan "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "hsotg" 12
Programming view of DWC_otg controller
.IP "chan" 12
Information needed to initialize the host channel. The xfer_len value
may be reduced to accommodate the max widths of the XferSize and
PktCnt fields in the HCTSIZn register. The multi_count value may be
changed to reflect the final xfer_len value.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function may be called in either Slave mode or DMA mode. In Slave mode,
the caller must ensure that there is sufficient space in the request queue
and Tx Data FIFO.

For an OUT transfer in Slave mode, it loads a data packet into the
appropriate FIFO. If necessary, additional data packets are loaded in the
Host ISR.

For an IN transfer in Slave mode, a data packet is requested. The data
packets are unloaded from the Rx FIFO in the Host ISR. If necessary,
additional data packets are requested in the Host ISR.

For a PING transfer in Slave mode, the Do Ping bit is set in the HCTSIZ
register along with a packet count of 1 and the channel is enabled. This
causes a single PING transaction to occur. Other fields in HCTSIZ are
simply set to 0 since no data transfer occurs in this case.

For a PING transfer in DMA mode, the HCTSIZ register is initialized with
all the information required to perform the subsequent data transfer. In
addition, the Do Ping bit is set in the HCTSIZ register. In this case, the
controller performs the entire PING protocol, then starts the data
transfer.
