.SH NAME
drm_gem_handle_create \- create a gem handle for an object
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" drm_gem_handle_create
.BI "(struct drm_file *file_priv "  ","
.BI "struct drm_gem_object *obj "  ","
.BI "u32 *handlep "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "file_priv" 12
drm file-private structure to register the handle for
.IP "obj" 12
object to register
.IP "handlep" 12
pointer to return the created handle to the caller
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Create a handle for this object. This adds a handle reference to the object,
which includes a regular reference count. Callers will likely want to
dereference the object afterwards.

Since this publishes \fIobj\fP to userspace it must be fully set up by this point,
drivers must call this last in their buffer object creation callbacks.
