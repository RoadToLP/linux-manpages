.IP "args" 12

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function allows the caller to switch the RPC transport for the
rpc_clnt structure 'clnt' to allow it to connect to a mirrored NFS
server, for instance.  It assumes that the caller has ensured that
there are no active RPC tasks by using some form of locking.

Returns zero if "clnt" is now using the new xprt.  Otherwise a
negative errno is returned, and "clnt" continues to use the old
xprt.
