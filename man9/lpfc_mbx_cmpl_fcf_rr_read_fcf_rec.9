.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This is the callback function for FLOGI failure roundrobin FCF failover
read FCF record mailbox command from the eligible FCF record bmask for
performing the failover. If the FCF read back is not valid/available, it
fails through to retrying FLOGI to the currently registered FCF again.
Otherwise, if the FCF read back is valid and available, it will set the
newly read FCF record to the failover FCF record, unregister currently
registered FCF record, copy the failover FCF record to the current
FCF record, and then register the current FCF record before proceeding
to trying FLOGI on the new failover FCF.
