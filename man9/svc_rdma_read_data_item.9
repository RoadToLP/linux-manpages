.SH NAME
svc_rdma_read_data_item \- Construct RDMA Reads to pull data item Read chunks
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" svc_rdma_read_data_item
.BI "(struct svc_rdma_read_info *info "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "info" 12
context for RDMA Reads
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The chunk data lands in the page list of head->rc_arg.pages.

Currently NFSD does not look at the head->rc_arg.tail[0] iovec.
Therefore, XDR round-up of the Read chunk and trailing
inline content must both be added at the end of the pagelist.

Return values:
0: RDMA Read WQEs were successfully built
-EINVAL: client provided too many chunks or segments,
-ENOMEM: rdma_rw context pool was exhausted,
-ENOTCONN: posting failed (connection is lost),
-EIO: rdma_rw initialization failed (DMA mapping, etc).
