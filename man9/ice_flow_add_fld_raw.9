.SH NAME
ice_flow_add_fld_raw \- sets locations of a raw field from entry's input buf
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" ice_flow_add_fld_raw
.BI "(struct ice_flow_seg_info *seg "  ","
.BI "u16 off "  ","
.BI "u8 len "  ","
.BI "u16 val_loc "  ","
.BI "u16 mask_loc "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "seg" 12
packet segment the field being set belongs to
.IP "off" 12
offset of the raw field from the beginning of the segment in bytes
.IP "len" 12
length of the raw pattern to be matched
.IP "val_loc" 12
location of the value to match from entry's input buffer
.IP "mask_loc" 12
location of mask value from entry's input buffer
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function specifies the offset of the raw field to be match from the
beginning of the specified packet segment, and the locations, in the form of
byte offsets from the start of the input buffer for a flow entry, from where
the value to match and the mask value to be extracted. These locations are
then stored in the flow profile. When adding flow entries to the associated
flow profile, these locations can be used to quickly extract the values to
create the content of a match entry. This function should only be used for
fixed-size data structures.
