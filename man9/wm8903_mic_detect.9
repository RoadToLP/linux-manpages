.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Enable microphone detection via IRQ on the WM8903.  If GPIOs are
being used to bring out signals to the processor then only platform
data configuration is needed for WM8903 and processor GPIOs should
be configured using \fBsnd_soc_jack_add_gpios\fP instead.

The current threasholds for detection should be configured using
micdet_cfg in the platform data.  Using this function will force on
the microphone bias for the device.
