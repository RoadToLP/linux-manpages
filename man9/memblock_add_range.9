.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Add new memblock region [\fIbase\fP, \fIbase\fP + \fIsize\fP) into \fItype\fP.  The new region
is allowed to overlap with existing ones - overlaps don't affect already
existing regions.  \fItype\fP is guaranteed to be minimal (all neighbouring
compatible regions are merged) after the addition.
.SH "RETURN"
0 on success, -errno on failure.
