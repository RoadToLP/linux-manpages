.SH "DESCRIPTION"

- tcon refcount is the number of mount points using the tcon.
- ses refcount is the number of tcon using the session.

1. This function assumes it is being called from \fBcifs_mount\fP where
we already got a session reference (ses refcount +1).

2. Since we're in the context of adding a mount point, the end
result should be either:

a) a new tcon already allocated with refcount=1 (1 mount point) and
its session refcount incremented (1 new tcon). This +1 was
already done in (1).

b) an existing tcon with refcount+1 (add a mount point to it) and
identical ses refcount (no new tcon). Because of (1) we need to
decrement the ses refcount.
