.SH NAME
mempool_resize \- resize an existing memory pool
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" mempool_resize
.BI "(mempool_t *pool "  ","
.BI "int new_min_nr "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "pool" 12
pointer to the memory pool which was allocated via
\fBmempool_create\fP.
.IP "new_min_nr" 12
the new minimum number of elements guaranteed to be
allocated for this pool.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function shrinks/grows the pool. In the case of growing,
it cannot be guaranteed that the pool will be grown to the new
size immediately, but new \fBmempool_free\fP calls will refill it.
This function may sleep.

Note, the caller must guarantee that no mempool_destroy is called
while this function is running. \fBmempool_alloc\fP & \fBmempool_free\fP
might be called (eg. from IRQ contexts) while this function executes.
.SH "RETURN"
0 on success, negative error code otherwise.
