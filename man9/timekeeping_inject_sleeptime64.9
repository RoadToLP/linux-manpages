.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This hook is for architectures that cannot support read_persistent_clock64
because their RTC/persistent clock is only accessible when irqs are enabled.
and also don't have an effective nonstop clocksource.

This function should only be called by \fBrtc_resume\fP, and allows
a suspend offset to be injected into the timekeeping values.
