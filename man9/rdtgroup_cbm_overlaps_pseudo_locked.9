.SH NAME
rdtgroup_cbm_overlaps_pseudo_locked \- Test if CBM or portion is pseudo-locked
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "bool" rdtgroup_cbm_overlaps_pseudo_locked
.BI "(struct rdt_domain *d "  ","
.BI "unsigned long cbm "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "d" 12
RDT domain
.IP "cbm" 12
CBM to test
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fId\fP represents a cache instance and \fIcbm\fP a capacity bitmask that is
considered for it. Determine if \fIcbm\fP overlaps with any existing
pseudo-locked region on \fId\fP.

\fIcbm\fP is unsigned long, even if only 32 bits are used, to make the
bitmap functions work correctly.
.SH "RETURN"
true if \fIcbm\fP overlaps with pseudo-locked region on \fId\fP, false
otherwise.
