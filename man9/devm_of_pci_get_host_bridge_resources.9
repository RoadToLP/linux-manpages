.SH NAME
devm_of_pci_get_host_bridge_resources \- Resource-managed parsing of PCI host bridge resources from DT
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" devm_of_pci_get_host_bridge_resources
.BI "(struct device *dev "  ","
.BI "unsigned char busno "  ","
.BI "unsigned char bus_max "  ","
.BI "struct list_head *resources "  ","
.BI "struct list_head *ib_resources "  ","
.BI "resource_size_t *io_base "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dev" 12
host bridge device
.IP "busno" 12
bus number associated with the bridge root bus
.IP "bus_max" 12
maximum number of buses for this bridge
.IP "resources" 12
list where the range of resources will be added after DT parsing
.IP "ib_resources" 12
list where the range of inbound resources (with addresses
from 'dma-ranges') will be added after DT parsing
.IP "io_base" 12
pointer to a variable that will contain on return the physical
address for the start of the I/O range. Can be NULL if the caller doesn't
expect I/O ranges to be present in the device tree.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function will parse the "ranges" property of a PCI host bridge device
node and setup the resource mapping based on its content. It is expected
that the property conforms with the Power ePAPR document.

It returns zero if the range parsing has been successful or a standard error
value if it failed.
