.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This is the central routine for resuming USB devices.  It calls the
the resume method for \fIudev\fP and then calls the resume methods for all
the interface drivers in \fIudev\fP.

Autoresume requests originating from a child device or an interface
driver may be made without the protection of \fIudev\fP's device lock, but
all other resume calls will hold the lock.  Usbcore will insure that
method calls do not arrive during bind, unbind, or reset operations.
However drivers must be prepared to handle resume calls arriving at
unpredictable times.

This routine can run only in process context.
.SH "RETURN"
0 on success.
