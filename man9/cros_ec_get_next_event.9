.SH NAME
cros_ec_get_next_event \- Fetch next event from the ChromeOS EC.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" cros_ec_get_next_event
.BI "(struct cros_ec_device *ec_dev "  ","
.BI "bool *wake_event "  ","
.BI "bool *has_more_events "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "ec_dev" 12
Device to fetch event from.
.IP "wake_event" 12
Pointer to a bool set to true upon return if the event might be
treated as a wake event. Ignored if null.
.IP "has_more_events" 12
Pointer to bool set to true if more than one event is
pending.
Some EC will set this flag to indicate \fBcros_ec_get_next_event\fP
can be called multiple times in a row.
It is an optimization to prevent issuing a EC command for
nothing or wait for another interrupt from the EC to process
the next message.
Ignored if null.
.SH "RETURN"
negative error code on errors; 0 for no data; or else number of
bytes received (i.e., an event was retrieved successfully). Event types are
written out to \fIec_dev->event_data.event_type\fP on success.
