.SH NAME
ib_drain_rq \- Block until all RQ CQEs have been consumed by the application.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" ib_drain_rq
.BI "(struct ib_qp *qp "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "qp" 12
queue pair to drain
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
If the device has a provider-specific drain function, then
call that.  Otherwise call the generic drain function
\fB__ib_drain_rq\fP.

The caller must:

ensure there is room in the CQ and RQ for the drain work request and
completion.

allocate the CQ using \fBib_alloc_cq\fP.

ensure that there are no other contexts that are posting WRs concurrently.
Otherwise the drain is not guaranteed.
