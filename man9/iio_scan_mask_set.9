.SH NAME
iio_scan_mask_set \- set particular bit in the scan mask
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" iio_scan_mask_set
.BI "(struct iio_dev *indio_dev "  ","
.BI "struct iio_buffer *buffer "  ","
.BI "int bit "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "indio_dev" 12
the iio device
.IP "buffer" 12
the buffer whose scan mask we are interested in
.IP "bit" 12
the bit to be set.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Note that at this point we have no way of knowing what other
buffers might request, hence this code only verifies that the
individual buffers request is plausible.
