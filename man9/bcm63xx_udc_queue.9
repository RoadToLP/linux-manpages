.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" bcm63xx_udc_queue
.BI "(struct usb_ep *ep "  ","
.BI "struct usb_request *req "  ","
.BI "gfp_t mem_flags "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "ep" 12
Endpoint associated with the request.
.IP "req" 12
Request to add.
.IP "mem_flags" 12
Unused.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
If the queue is empty, start this request immediately.  Otherwise, add
it to the list.

ep0 replies are sent through this function from the gadget driver, but
they are treated differently because they need to be handled by the ep0
state machine.  (Sometimes they are replies to control requests that
were spoofed by this driver, and so they shouldn't be transmitted at all.)
