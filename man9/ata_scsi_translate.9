.SH NAME
ata_scsi_translate \- Translate then issue SCSI command to ATA device
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" ata_scsi_translate
.BI "(struct ata_device *dev "  ","
.BI "struct scsi_cmnd *cmd "  ","
.BI "ata_xlat_func_t xlat_func "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dev" 12
ATA device to which the command is addressed
.IP "cmd" 12
SCSI command to execute
.IP "xlat_func" 12
Actor which translates \fIcmd\fP to an ATA taskfile

Our ->\fBqueuecommand\fP function has decided that the SCSI
command issued can be directly translated into an ATA
command, rather than handled internally.

This function sets up an ata_queued_cmd structure for the
SCSI command, and sends that ata_queued_cmd to the hardware.

The xlat_func argument (actor) returns 0 if ready to execute
ATA command, else 1 to finish translation. If 1 is returned
then cmd->result (and possibly cmd->sense_buffer) are assumed
to be set reflecting an error condition or clean (early)
termination.

LOCKING:
spin_lock_irqsave(host lock)
.SH "RETURN"
0 on success, SCSI_ML_QUEUE_DEVICE_BUSY if the command
needs to be deferred.
