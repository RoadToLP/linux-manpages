.SH SYNOPSIS

.BI "(struct tb *tb "  ","
.BI "const uuid_t *uuid "  ");"

.IP "tb" 12
Domain where the XDomain belongs to
.IP "uuid" 12
UUID to look for
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Finds XDomain by walking through the Thunderbolt topology below \fItb\fP.
The returned XDomain will have its reference count increased so the
caller needs to call \fBtb_xdomain_put\fP when it is done with the
object.

This will find all XDomains including the ones that are not yet added
to the bus (handshake is still in progress).

The caller needs to hold \fItb->lock\fP.
