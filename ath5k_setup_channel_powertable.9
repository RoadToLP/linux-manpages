.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "ah" 12
The \fIstruct ath5k_hw\fP
.IP "channel" 12
The \fIstruct ieee80211_channel\fP
.IP "ee_mode" 12
One of enum ath5k_driver_mode
.IP "type" 12
One of enum ath5k_powertable_type (eeprom.h)
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This is the main function that uses all of the above
to set PCDAC/PDADC table on hw for the current channel.
This table is used for tx power calibration on the baseband,
without it we get weird tx power levels and in some cases
distorted spectral mask
