.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "hw" 12
pointer to the hardware structure
.IP "buf" 12
pointer to the result buffer
.IP "buf_size" 12
length of the buffer available for response
.IP "req_desc" 12
pointer to requested descriptor
.IP "num_elems" 12
pointer to number of elements
.IP "cd" 12
pointer to command details structure or NULL
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Get switch configuration (0x0200) to be placed in buf.
This admin command returns information such as initial VSI/port number
and switch ID it belongs to.

*num_elems is output only parameter. This reflects the number of elements
in response buffer. The caller of this function to use *num_elems while
parsing the response buffer.
.SH "NOTE"
*req_desc is both an input/output parameter.
The caller of this function first calls this function with *request_desc set
to 0. If the response from f/w has *req_desc set to 0, all the switch
configuration information has been returned; if non-zero (meaning not all
the information was returned), the caller should call this function again
with *req_desc set to the previous value returned by f/w to get the
next block of switch configuration information.
