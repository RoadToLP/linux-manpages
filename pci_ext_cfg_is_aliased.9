.SH "DESCRIPTION"
PCI Express to PCI/PCI-X Bridge Specification, rev 1.0, 4.1.4 says that
when forwarding a type1 configuration request the bridge must check that
the extended register address field is zero.  The bridge is not permitted
to forward the transactions and must handle it as an Unsupported Request.
Some bridges do not follow this rule and simply drop the extended register
bits, resulting in the standard config space being aliased, every 256
bytes across the entire configuration space.  Test for this condition by
comparing the first dword of each potential alias to the vendor/device ID.
Known offenders:
ASM1083/1085 PCIe-to-PCI Reversible Bridge (1b21:1080, rev 01 & 03)
AMD/ATI SBx00 PCI to PCI Bridge (1002:4384, rev 40)
