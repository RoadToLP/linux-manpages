.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" cgroup_update_populated

.BI "bool populated "  ");"

inc or dec populated count
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
One of the css_sets associated with \fIcgrp\fP is either getting its first
task or losing the last.  Update \fIcgrp->nr_populated_\fP* accordingly.  The
count is propagated towards root so that a given cgroup's
nr_populated_children is zero iff none of its descendants contain any
tasks.

\fIcgrp\fP's interface file "cgroup.populated" is zero if both
\fIcgrp->nr_populated_csets\fP and \fIcgrp->nr_populated_children\fP are zero and
1 otherwise.  When the sum changes from or to zero, userland is notified
that the content of the interface file has changed.  This can be used to
detect when \fIcgrp\fP and its descendants become populated or empty.
