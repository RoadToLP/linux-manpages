.SH NAME
comedi_auto_unconfig \- Unconfigure auto-allocated COMEDI device
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" comedi_auto_unconfig
.BI "(struct device *hardware_device "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "hardware_device" 12
Hardware device previously passed to
\fBcomedi_auto_config\fP.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Cleans up and eventually destroys the COMEDI device allocated by
\fBcomedi_auto_config\fP for the same hardware device.  As part of this
clean-up, the low-level COMEDI driver's 'detach' handler will be called.
(The COMEDI device itself will persist in an unattached state if it is
still open, until it is released, and any mmapped buffers will persist
until they are munmapped.)

This is usually called from a wrapper module in a bus-specific COMEDI
module, which in turn is usually set as the bus device 'remove' function
in the low-level COMEDI driver.
