.SH NAME
lpfc_bg_setup_bpl \- Setup BlockGuard BPL with no protection data
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" lpfc_bg_setup_bpl
.BI "(struct lpfc_hba *phba "  ","
.BI "struct scsi_cmnd *sc "  ","
.BI "struct ulp_bde64 *bpl "  ","
.BI "int datasegcnt "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "phba" 12
The Hba for which this call is being executed.
.IP "sc" 12
pointer to scsi command we're working on
.IP "bpl" 12
pointer to buffer list for protection groups
.IP "datasegcnt" 12
number of segments of data that have been dma mapped
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function sets up BPL buffer list for protection groups of
type LPFC_PG_TYPE_NO_DIF

This is usually used when the HBA is instructed to generate
DIFs and insert them into data stream (or strip DIF from
incoming data stream)

The buffer list consists of just one protection group described
below:
+-------------------------+
start of prot group  -->     |          PDE_5          |
+-------------------------+
|          PDE_6          |
+-------------------------+
|         Data BDE        |
+-------------------------+
|more Data BDE's ... (opt)|
+-------------------------+


Returns the number of BDEs added to the BPL.
.SH "NOTE"
Data s/g buffers have been dma mapped
