create_field_var_hist \- Automatically create a histogram and var for a field
.SH SYNOPSIS

.BI "(struct hist_trigger_data *target_hist_data "  ","
.BI "char *subsys_name "  ","
.BI "char *event_name "  ","
.BI "char *field_name "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "target_hist_data" 12
The target hist trigger
.IP "subsys_name" 12
Optional subsystem name
.IP "event_name" 12
Optional event name
.IP "field_name" 12
The name of the field (and the resulting variable)
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Hist trigger actions fetch data from variables, not directly from
events.  However, for convenience, users are allowed to directly
specify an event field in an action, which will be automatically
converted into a variable on their behalf.
If a user specifies a field on an event that isn't the event the
histogram currently being defined (the target event histogram), the
only way that can be accomplished is if a new hist trigger is
created and the field variable defined on that.

This function creates a new histogram compatible with the target
event (meaning a histogram with the same key as the target
histogram), and creates a variable for the specified field, but
with 'synthetic_' prepended to the variable name in order to avoid
collision with normal field variables.
.SH "RETURN"
The variable created for the field.
