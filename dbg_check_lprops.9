.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function checks all LEB properties and makes sure they are all correct.
It returns zero if everything is fine, -EINVAL if there is an inconsistency
and other negative error codes in case of other errors. This function is
called while the file system is locked (because of commit start), so no
additional locking is required. Note that locking the LPT mutex would cause
a circular lock dependency with the TNC mutex.
