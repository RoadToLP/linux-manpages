.SH NAME
device_create_managed_software_node \- Create a software node for a device
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" device_create_managed_software_node
.BI "(struct device *dev "  ","
.BI "const struct property_entry *properties "  ","
.BI "const struct software_node *parent "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dev" 12
The device the software node is assigned to.
.IP "properties" 12
Device properties for the software node.
.IP "parent" 12
Parent of the software node.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Creates a software node as a managed resource for \fIdev\fP, which means the
lifetime of the newly created software node is tied to the lifetime of \fIdev\fP.
Software nodes created with this function should not be reused or shared
because of that. The function takes a deep copy of \fIproperties\fP for the
software node.

Since the new software node is assigned directly to \fIdev\fP, and since it should
not be shared, it is not returned to the caller. The function returns 0 on
success, and errno in case of an error.
