.SH "DESCRIPTION"
For LUNs in virtual mode, the virtual LUN associated with the specified
resource handle is resized to 0 prior to releasing the RHTE. Note that the
AFU sync should _not_ be performed when the context is sitting on the error
recovery list. A context on the error recovery list is not known to the AFU
due to reset. When the context is recovered, it will be reattached and made
known again to the AFU.
