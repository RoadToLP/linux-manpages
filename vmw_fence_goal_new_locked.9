.SH NAME
vmw_fence_goal_new_locked \- Figure out a new device fence goal seqno if needed.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "bool" vmw_fence_goal_new_locked
.BI "(struct vmw_fence_manager *fman "  ","
.BI "u32 passed_seqno "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "fman" 12
Pointer to a fence manager.
.IP "passed_seqno" 12
The seqno the device currently signals as passed.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function should be called with the fence manager lock held.
It is typically called when we have a new passed_seqno, and
we might need to update the fence goal. It checks to see whether
the current fence goal has already passed, and, in that case,
scans through all unsignaled fences to get the next fence object with an
action attached, and sets the seqno of that fence as a new fence goal.

returns true if the device goal seqno was updated. False otherwise.
