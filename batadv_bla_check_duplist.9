.SH NAME
batadv_bla_check_duplist \- Check if a frame is in the broadcast dup.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "bool" batadv_bla_check_duplist
.BI "(struct batadv_priv *bat_priv "  ","
.BI "struct sk_buff *skb "  ","
.BI "u8 *payload_ptr "  ","
.BI "const u8 *orig "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "bat_priv" 12
the bat priv with all the soft interface information
.IP "skb" 12
contains the multicast packet to be checked
.IP "payload_ptr" 12
pointer to position inside the head buffer of the skb
marking the start of the data to be CRC'ed
.IP "orig" 12
originator mac address, NULL if unknown
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Check if it is on our broadcast list. Another gateway might have sent the
same packet because it is connected to the same backbone, so we have to
remove this duplicate.

This is performed by checking the CRC, which will tell us
with a good chance that it is the same packet. If it is furthermore
sent by another host, drop it. We allow equal packets from
the same host however as this might be intended.
.SH "RETURN"
true if a packet is in the duplicate list, false otherwise.
