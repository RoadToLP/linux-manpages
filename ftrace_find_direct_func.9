ftrace_find_direct_func \- test an address if it is a registered direct caller
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "struct ftrace_direct_func *" ftrace_find_direct_func
.BI "(unsigned long addr "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "addr" 12
The address of a registered direct caller
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This searches to see if a ftrace direct caller has been registered
at a specific address, and if so, it returns a descriptor for it.

This can be used by architecture code to see if an address is
a direct caller (trampoline) attached to a fentry/mcount location.
This is useful for the function_graph tracer, as it may need to
do adjustments if it traced a location that also has a direct
trampoline attached to it.
