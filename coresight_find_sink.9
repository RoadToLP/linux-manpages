.BI "int *depth "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "csdev" 12
source / current device to check.
.IP "depth" 12
[in] search depth of calling dev, [out] depth of found sink.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This will walk the connection path from a source (ETM) till a suitable
sink is encountered and return that sink to the original caller.

If current device is a plain sink return that & depth, otherwise recursively
