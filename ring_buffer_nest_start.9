.SH NAME
ring_buffer_nest_start \- Allow to trace while nested
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" ring_buffer_nest_start
.BI "(struct trace_buffer *buffer "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "buffer" 12
The ring buffer to modify
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The ring buffer has a safety mechanism to prevent recursion.
But there may be a case where a trace needs to be done while
tracing something else. In this case, calling this function
will allow this function to nest within a currently active
\fBring_buffer_lock_reserve\fP.

Call this function before calling another \fBring_buffer_lock_reserve\fP and
call \fBring_buffer_nest_end\fP after the nested \fBring_buffer_unlock_commit\fP.
