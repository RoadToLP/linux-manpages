.IP "wait" 12
Time-out in jiffies, 0 if sleeping is not allowed
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Polls the chip in a reasonably efficient manner waiting for an
event to occur. After a short quick poll we begin to yield the CPU
(if possible). In irq contexts the time-out is arbitrarily limited.
Callers may hold locks as long as they are held in irq mode.

Returns 0 if either or both event(s) occurred otherwise -ETIMEDOUT.
