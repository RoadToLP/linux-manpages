.B "struct regulator *" regulator_get_exclusive
.BI "(struct device *dev "  ","
.BI "const char *id "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dev" 12
device for regulator "consumer"
.IP "id" 12
Supply name or regulator ID.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Returns a struct regulator corresponding to the regulator producer,
or \fBIS_ERR\fP condition containing errno.  Other consumers will be
unable to obtain this regulator while this reference is held and the
use count for the regulator will be initialised to reflect the current
state of the regulator.

This is intended for use by consumers which cannot tolerate shared
use of the regulator such as those which need to force the
regulator off for correct operation of the hardware they are
controlling.

Use of supply names configured via \fBset_consumer_device_supply\fP is
strongly encouraged.  It is recommended that the supply name used
should match the name used for the supply and/or the relevant
device pins in the datasheet.
