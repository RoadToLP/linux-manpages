.SH NAME
gsi_evt_ring_rx_update \- Record lengths of received data
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "void" gsi_evt_ring_rx_update
.BI "(struct gsi_evt_ring *evt_ring "  ","
.BI "u32 index "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "evt_ring" 12
Event ring associated with channel that received packets
.IP "index" 12
Event index in ring reported by hardware
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Events for RX channels contain the actual number of bytes received into
the buffer.  Every event has a transaction associated with it, and here
we update transactions to record their actual received lengths.

This function is called whenever we learn that the GSI hardware has filled
new events since the last time we checked.  The ring's index field tells
the first entry in need of processing.  The index provided is the
first *unfilled* event in the ring (following the last filled one).

Events are sequential within the event ring, and transactions are
sequential within the transaction pool.

Note that \fIindex\fP always refers to an element *within* the event ring.
