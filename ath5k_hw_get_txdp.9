.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Get TX descriptor's address for a specific queue. For 5210 we ignore
the queue number and use tx queue type since we only have 2 queues.
We use TXDP0 for normal data queue and TXDP1 for beacon queue.
For newer chips with QCU/DCU we just read the corresponding TXDP register.

XXX: Is TXDP read and clear ?
