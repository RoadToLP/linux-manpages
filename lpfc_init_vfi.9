This routine initializes \fImbox\fP to all zeros and then fills in the mailbox
fields from \fIvport\fP. INIT_VFI configures virtual fabrics identified by VFI
in the context of an FCF. The driver issues this command to setup a VFI
before issuing a FLOGI to login to the VSAN. The driver should also issue a
REG_VFI after a successful VSAN login.
