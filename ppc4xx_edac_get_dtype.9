.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This routine returns the EDAC device type width appropriate for the
current controller configuration.

TODO: This needs to be conditioned dynamically through feature
flags or some such when other controller variants are supported as
the 405EX[r] is 16-/32-bit and the others are 32-/64-bit with the
16- and 64-bit field definition/value/enumeration (b1) overloaded
among them.

Returns a device type width enumeration.
