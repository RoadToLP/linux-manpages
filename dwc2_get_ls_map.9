.SH NAME
dwc2_get_ls_map \- Get the map used for the given qh
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "unsigned long *" dwc2_get_ls_map
.BI "(struct dwc2_hsotg *hsotg "  ","
.BI "struct dwc2_qh *qh "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "hsotg" 12
The HCD state structure for the DWC OTG controller.
.IP "qh" 12
QH for the periodic transfer.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
We'll always get the periodic map out of our TT.  Note that even if we're
running the host straight in low speed / full speed mode it appears as if
a TT is allocated for us, so we'll use it.  If that ever changes we can
add logic here to get a map out of "hsotg" if !qh->do_split.
.SH "RETURN"
the map or NULL if a map couldn't be found.
